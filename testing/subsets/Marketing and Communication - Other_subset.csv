The benefit of an internship is to enhance the classroom education with practical applied experience in the real world. An Internship can be a method of on the job training for professional careers.  Although interns are typically college or university students,  they can also be high school students or post-  graduate adults. On occasion,  they are middle school or even elementary students. In some countries,  internships for school children are called work experience. Internships may be paid or unpaid,  and are usually understood to be temporary positions. Unpaid and low- paid internships can run afoul of minimum wage laws,  which sometimes have exceptions for educational positions.  How important is it really to do an internship before applying for a job Do you need to get the hands- on experience that is talked about when discussing the importance of internships or is it really a matter of just landing the right job   What if I dont have time to do an internship   During the school year students may feel overwhelmed with coursework,  sports,  or co- curricular activities that may keep them extremely busy while leaving no time to think of doing an internship or a job. Many students may also feel that they are caught in a bind since they need to make money to pay for their expenses but they can only find unpaid internships in their field.   Getting Your Feet Wet by Doing an Internship:   Internships are a proven way to gain relevant knowledge,  skills,  and experience while establishing important connections in the field. Internships are also a way to get your feet wet and find out if a specific field is something you could see yourself doing as a full- time job. Internships may be completed during fall or spring semester or full time over the course of the summer. Unpaid internships may be easier to get but may also pose problems if making money is necessary,  especially during the summer. The problem is there are many who cannot afford to work for nothing so that they are forced into doing menial jobs in order to work their way through college. This may preclude some from doing an internship which may really be a detriment when hoping to get a full- time job.   Financial Considerations When Doing an Internship:   Financial considerations when looking for an internship can make a big difference in the decision- making process. Sometimes students will do a part- time or full- time job to supplement the time that they are spending at their internship. Whether an internship is paid or unpaid there are many things that need to be taken into consideration in order to decide if an internship is worthwhile. Its important to decide if an internship will ultimately be in the best interest of the student in order to help them meet the requirements they will need when applying for a full- time job.   Doing an Internship and a Job:   Students may elect to do a summer internship a couple of days per week while working a part- time job for the remainder of the time. For those who need to maximize the amount of money they make over the course of the summer,  they may look into doing an internship during the academic year when they are less likely to expect to make money to help defray their college expenses. In addition to internships,  volunteer opportunities can also be an excellent way to gain experience and exposure to the work force. Employers love to see volunteer experiences on a students resume. Volunteering shows commitment to causes and certain values that are intrinsic to the individual who have participated in these types of experiences. Employers look for employees who are publicly engaged and who take an interest in community service and in doing good work.   What Employers Want   Internships and volunteer experiences make candidates more competitive in the job market. In addition to gaining exposure and experience in the field,  they also provide an opportunity to see if the particular career field is the right one based on getting personal experience in the field. No matter what opportunities you engage in,  its important to maintain professionalism and take on the individual responsibility that is required.   The Benefits of Doing an Internship   By doing a great job and completing more than what is required of you in your internship,  you will be creating a great impression that can provide a great reference letter at the least and may even potentially lead to a potential job offer. When you leave the organization at the end of the internship,  you should ask for a recommendation letter that you can keep on file for future reference.   Internships are a Learning Experience:   Internships are a great way to learn the ropes so even if you find yourself filing or making coffee,  as long as youre learning about the field take advantage of the opportunity and dont take the experience lightly. Asking questions is one key to learning in an internship and keeping yourself flexible throughout the internship can open many doors.  Generally,  an internship consists of an exchange of services for experience between the student and an organization. Students can also use an internship to determine if they have an interest in a particular career,  create a network of contacts,  or gain school credit. Some interns find permanent,  paid employment with the organizations with which they interned. This can be a significant benefit to the employer as experienced interns often need little or no training when they begin regular employment. Unlike a trainee program,  however,  employment at the completion of an internship is not guaranteed.  Therefore an internship can be highly beneficial when done during college,  as it helps you gain knowledge about the industry you will be working with,  in the near future.",1.91E+11,05-09-2023,04-12-2023,EducationalOccupationalCredential,24,Marketing & Communication,Marketing and Communication - Other,Film / Music / Entertainment,"Digital media, Intern, Illustrator, Social media, Project management, Photoshop, Facebook, Internship, Sports",-,9am-6pm,"Full Time, Permanent",Fruitbowl Digital,Organization,Fruitbowl Digital,-,Mumbai,Mumbai,-,-,-,Unpaid P.M ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Marketing and Communication - Other

Internet journalists,"Internet journalists Another small breed of Internet professionals are Internet journalists - people who develop content exclusively for a content based website. Rediff On The Net is the first Indian publication on the Internet without a corresponding print counterpart. While most publications in India put their printed content on the Internet, Rediff On The Net has a team of journalists who work exclusively to report news and write features on Rediff.com, as and when stories break. Making the switch to Internet journalism requires the traditional journalist to be conversant with HTML to be able to directly file his story or news as a webpage, allowing news to be instantly updated on the Web, instead of introducing delays via a separate team of people who convert news items to webpages. While all the job profiles mentioned above have varying requirements, one common requirement for anyone applying for a job in the Internet industry is exposure to the Internet. Shailesh Joshi, VP, Operations, Rediff On The Net, goes a step ahead and looks out for people with a passion for the Internet, besides expertise in their respective field.  All said and done, a job in the Internet industry is not for everyone. A passion for the Internet is a must - and that love is what makes the long hours (often 10-12 hours a day, some all-nighters), and unreasonable deadlines worth it all - that's job satisfaction for you. As for salaries - well that's another area that's vague and covers a wide range, depending on the size of the organisation, and the applicant's experience and expertise. Suffice to say that salaries are usually in keeping with the average salaries in other industries - an Internet programmer would earn as much as he would in a software development firm, while a sales marketing person would earn as much as his counterpart in say, the consumer goods industry.
