Themost challenging green fuel for dry low emission combustion is hydrogen andhydrogen enriched fuels due to its high reactivity moving the flame upstreamcausing risk of excessive heat load on the burner. The burners and the flamesare a central part of a gas turbine, and they are utterly important to minimizethe combustion dynamics and emission levels, as well as maximizing the fuelflexibility and optimizing lifetime of the structure. Therefore, it isimportant to improve our combustion prediction of hydrogen enriched fuels andperform model calibration to measurement data as part of this role.         In the development process we use network models (one dimensionalinhouse code), Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), acoustic simulations, watertests, atmospheric and high-pressure combustion tests, and gas turbine enginetests.         The goal of this role is to enhance our knowledge for studying theperformance of numerical simulations of hydrogen enriched and other greenliquid fuels for combustion and evaluate the results either to alreadyperformed combustion tests or development projects.         In the near future once you grasped the concept you will also beinvolved to supporting the existing fleet where you will learn more about theengine behaviors in conjunction with the theory you have already developed.
