Copywriter,"Copywriter The web is very different from the print medium  -  while people would read Shobha De's latest book in its print version  , they would not spend time reading it online. The same applies to any writing on the Internet. So putting a print brochure of a company on the Internet as is  , makes for a very bad website. Since surfing itself is an activity that encourages people to quickly move from one website to another  , copywriters are needed to write compelling copy for the Internet  , to catch and retain the interest of the surfer. Copywriters need to be able to turn even the most boring bits of information into something that the reader would spend his precious online time on. A good example is the webpage on a corporate website that talks about the company  , it's founders blah  , blah  , blah. A good copywriter would be able to turn that into something interesting  , with a style that catches the attention of the casual surfer as well as gives the serious information hungry surfer whatever details he's on the lookout for.",2.81E+11,28-06-2018,26-09-2018,EducationalOccupationalCredential,24,Marketing & Communication,Copywriter,Film / Music / Entertainment,"marketing executive, distributors, customer profiling, sales strategy, market research, Business Development, sales executive",-,9am-6pm,"Full Time, Permanent",The Strategist,Organization,The Strategist,https://img.naukimg.com/logo_images/groups/v1/145052.gif,Hyderabad,Hyderabad,-,-,-,Not disclosed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Copywriter
