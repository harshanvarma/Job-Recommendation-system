React Native Professional,"React Native is an open-source framework developed by Facebook for building cross-platform mobile applications using JavaScript and React. Here's an overview of React Native and its key features: Cross-Platform Development: React Native allows developers to build mobile applications for multiple platforms, including iOS and Android, using a single codebase. This enables faster development and reduces the need for separate development teams for each platform. Native Performance: Unlike hybrid frameworks, React Native enables developers to build mobile apps with native-like performance and user experience. It achieves this by rendering UI components using native APIs, resulting in smoother animations and faster load times. Reusable Components: React Native promotes component-based architecture, where UI elements are encapsulated into reusable components. This modular approach makes it easier to build, maintain, and update mobile applications, as components can be reused across different parts of the app or even in other projects. Hot Reloading: React Native comes with built-in support for hot reloading, allowing developers to see changes in real-time as they modify code. This speeds up the development process by eliminating the need for manual reloading and recompilation, resulting in a more efficient development workflow. JavaScript and React Ecosystem: React Native leverages the JavaScript language and the React library, which are widely used and supported by a large developer community. Developers familiar with JavaScript and React can quickly get started with React Native and leverage existing knowledge and resources. Third-Party Libraries and Plugins: React Native provides access to a vast ecosystem of third-party libraries and plugins, allowing developers to extend the functionality of their mobile apps easily. These libraries cover a wide range of features, including navigation, state management, networking, and UI components. Integration with Native Code: React Native allows developers to integrate platform-specific code written in Java (for Android) or Objective-C/Swift (for iOS) seamlessly into their projects. This enables access to device features and native APIs that may not be available out of the box in React Native. Community and Support: React Native has a vibrant and active community of developers who contribute to its development, provide support, and share knowledge and resources. This community-driven approach ensures that React Native stays up-to-date with the latest trends and technologies in mobile app development. Debugging Tools: React Native provides robust debugging tools, including Chrome Developer Tools and React Developer Tools, which enable developers to inspect and debug their apps more effectively. Additionally, tools like Reactotron provide advanced debugging capabilities specifically tailored for React Native development. Scalability and Performance: React Native is well-suited for building both small-scale and large-scale mobile applications. Its modular architecture, performance optimizations, and ability to leverage native APIs make it a scalable solution for building high-performance mobile apps that can handle complex use cases and large user bases.",1.60E+11,16-04-2024,15-07-2024,EducationalOccupationalCredential,120,Engineering - Software & QA,Mobile / App Developer,Recruitment / Staffing,"React Native, UI, Debugging, JavaScript, Objective-C, Swift, iOS, mobile app development",-,9am-6pm,"Full Time, Permanent",Net2Source LLP,Organization,Net2Source LLP,-,Bengaluru,Bengaluru,-,-,-,Not disclosed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Mobile / App Developer
