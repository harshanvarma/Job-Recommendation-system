Consultant Ivalua Source-to-Contract,"         The project will implement the Ivalua modules Souring, Contracts, and Supplier Management within the client Procurement organization, following the existing specific Source-to-Contract processes.                 Depending on implementation progress the modules Program Management, Issues Management & Collaboration Plans will be implemented as well. The implementation will cover all countries within the functionally steered procurement organization: Germany, Netherlands, Sweden, UK.                   Background to the assignment:                   To manage the project dependencies on the client side (staff, deliverables, needed decisions, timeline) in relation to this implementation project, the client is looking for an external resource with project manager skills that has experience with these particular implementation projects at Procurement and is familiar with strategic sourcing tools like iValua and Ariba.                   Tasks:                   Project planning, tracking, documentation in close coordination with our external implementation partner. This includes creating a project plan based on own experience and expertise and based on the specifics of this project which will be provided by the client in advance.                 Execute project meetings                 Coordinate engagements and decisions based on own expertise and based on in advance provided input from the client                  Coordinate the sign off s to be made by the client in context of this project within the (in advance) agreed implementation timelines. The implementation approach is a functional lift & shift , which is based on the existing Ariba Sourcing/Contract/SLP installation and its interface into SAP R/3 MM for supplier master data. However, the benefits of the Ivalua solution will be made available to the client Category Managers. Procurement is engaged within the implementation with the Sourcing, Contracts, and Supplier Management module owners, and local Procurement representatives.                 As an essential part of the implementation, create the training concept for the Procurement organization. This includes developing and actually realizing such training concept as part of the project.
