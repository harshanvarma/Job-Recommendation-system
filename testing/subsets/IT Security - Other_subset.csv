Back then we were providing consultancy services to medium-sized organizations. Business was good, and we grew quickly but over the years we became increasingly frustrated by the lack of suitable delivery options available to our clients. More often, they were forced to choose between enterprise applications (expensive), SaaS applications(inflexible), or proprietary applications (unscalable). As a result, their digital transformation strategy often failed to deliver all the competitive advantage it promised. We knew there must be a better way. So, in 2012 we set up the fledgling development and engineering arm of Tmotions. Today we employ over 70+ staff in our London headquarters and in our engineering hub in Chandigarh, serving clients in the UK, Europe, USA, Canada, UAE, and Australia.
