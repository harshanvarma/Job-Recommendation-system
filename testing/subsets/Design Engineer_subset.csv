Create tools for routine FEA analysis i.e. automation of the work process will be another task for the FEA analyst. Candidates must have knowledge of standards i.e. Codes like ASME, PD 5500, AD 2000, EN, etc. FEA Analyst must contribute in the growth of company by creating software tools for Ideametrics internal processes and analysis types with codal requirement.      Ideametrics was setup by people who have strong technical background graduate from IIT Bombay in Design Engineering and shown great aptitude for Engineering problem solving capabilities.      Any Engineer recruited in Ideametrics has to go through a training period wherein the gap between academic and industry expectations is filled gradually to make the candidate a great engineer first then to delegate complex engineering tasks. The training period is based on the premise to make the candidate into a complete engineer who will be a problem solver, capable of solving complex engineering tasks single handedly equipped with cutting edge tools. Consider this to be like a full - stack Mechanical Engineer like the Computer Science counterpart.      The training period starts with working on basic 3D modelling tasks, where starting with simple geometries the candidate progresses to modelling critical components that require through imagination. Once comfortable in 3D modelling and having gained enough domain knowledge, the candidate starts to assist our expert engineers in their analysis learning first hand from them and then replicating the tasks done by them. As the training progresses, the candidate is delegated tasks in Finite Element Analysis based on simple problems which are easy to understand gaining confidence and expertise step by step the candidate then becomes capable of handling problems moderately complicated and delivering project reports for the same. We believe at this point the candidate has transformed into an Engineer and may start working on our core tasks independently.
