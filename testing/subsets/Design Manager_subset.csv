Our growth has come from innovative, bold approaches to solving some of the world s most challenging communication technology problems in the most efficient and effective manner.                 MaxLinear began by developing the world s first high-performance TV tuner chip using standard CMOS process technology. Others said we couldn t achieve the extremely high-performance requirements using CMOS, but we proved them wrong and achieved enduring global market leadership with our designs. Since then, we ve developed a full line of products that drive 4G and 5G infrastructure; enable data center, metro and long-haul optical interconnects; bring 10Gbit to the home; power the IoT revolution; and enable robust and reliable communication in harsh industrial environments. Over the years, we ve expanded through organic growth and through several acquisitions that have perfectly complemented our existing portfolio and enabled us to deliver complete end-to-end solutions in our target markets. One such example was the acquisition of Intel s Home Gateway Platform Division that added Wi-Fi, Ethernet, and Broadband Gateway Processor SoC technology to our connected home portfolio creating a complete and scalable platform of connectivity and access solutions to fully address our customers needs.                 Our headquarters are in Carlsbad, near San Diego, California. We also have major design centers in Irvine and San Jose, California; Waltham, Massachusetts; Vancouver, Canada; Valencia, Spain; Bangalore and Chennai, India; Villach, Austria; Munich, Germany; Israel; and Singapore.                 We have approximately 1,500 employees, a substantial majority of whom have engineering degrees and include masters and Ph.D. graduates from many of the premiere universities around the world. Our employees thrive on innovation, outstanding execution, outside-the-box thinking, nimbleness, and collaboration. Together, we form a high-energy business team that is focused on building the best and most innovative products on the market.
