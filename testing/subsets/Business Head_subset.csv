Strategic Alliances & Partnerships Manager,"         At Setu, we believe that every company can become a fintech company     The sales function within Setu is the equivalent of becoming a fintech doctor for all our partners     Partnerships executives work with clients to deeply understand their business objectives and propose the right financial products and partnerships     Only then do they move to close the deal     We exist to solve our clientsproblems and enable a seamless fintech experience within any application     With Setu foraying into new product lines, it also gives us the opportunity to talk to market leaders in those domains and start building strategic partners, both to co-sell and co-create       Any tech-enabled business which wants to offer or build financial products will consume Setu APIs         Talking to our clients is always an exciting challenge as they can come from any type of company including                       Financial institutions like Banks                Reach to the market leaders in complementing domains and use them to push our products or to co-sell.               This role is special since it will give you a deep look into multiple companiesbusiness objectives and technical architecture.      The learning potential is immense               What will you do at Setu                   Finding new partners and creating a win-win proposition to close them:             Setu works with multiple types of channel partners including Banks, Bureaus and other complementing domain leaders like card networks to sell and co-create products.         You will be expected to build and deliver a strong pipeline of strategic partners across these categories using various methods includingdirect outreach, event-based networking and desk research.             In case of Banking partnership, it would be two-fold -               Establish a rapport with the Bank to encourage them to co-create unique and exclusive offerings to Setu.             Sell products to Banks developed by Setu or Setus partners which meets the requirement for Banks.              The approach in Banks will have a strategic long term angle to it as well as medium term revenue linked goals as well.                  Get partners to sign up and start growing the business.              We have stitched together some stellar partnerships like credit bureaus, card networks, etc                The expectation will be to groom those partnerships and add to the list.             What is the value prop for the partnerWhy should they work with Setu         Who are the key decision-makers at the partner orgHow do we get their full buy-in         How do you identify the Total Addressible Markets (TAM)         Which Setu products should be positioned first         Which partner clients would benefit most         How should a joint GTM strategy be defined and executed         Tell stories and demos that sear themselves into the partners memory             Managing and growing partners to create a multi-year multi-product relationship:                   Develop deep relationships once youve signed up key strategic partnersConceptualise and execute alliances with partners.

Conduct sales training regularly and accompany partner sales reps on calls to ensure their team pitches the products well.

To excel in this role, you will need                     Empathy:     We operate with a profoundly consultative approach. Empathy for the partner is a crucial requirement for this role.

Making them feel heard can make all the difference between a transactional relationship and a true long-term partnership.              Exceptional      storytelling skills      in both verbal and written form. Stories are the most effective way to communicate complex ideas.

A      burning desire to learn     and develop deep fintech expertise. Selling API infrastructure is a lot harder (and more rewarding) than selling cashbacks.

Architecture of legacy systems: In order to educate customers on how we can dramatically improve their business, you must first know where existing systems are broken.             Hands-on experience in solution-based sales and a deep understanding of APIs.                 Relentlessness:     Enterprise sales is all about two words. Following through. Partnerships are rarely closed in one conversation. You will need to be friendly, patient, and relentless.                 Agility and flexibility:     Setu provides many solutions. You might walk into a conversation planning to sell a particular product, but your conversations might reveal a different and more pressing customer need.              At that moment, you must have the presence of mind to alter your sales pitch to address that need and the pitch materials ready to go.                 Familiarity     with CRM systems, such as Salesforce, Pipedrive, Zoho and Trello A craftsman must know their tools.               Benefits             Opportunity to work closely with the founding team who built and scaled public infrastructure such as UPI, GST, Aadhaar, etc                We care deeply about your growth.
