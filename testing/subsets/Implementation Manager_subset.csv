"Programme Manager , Operations","       About the Role         The Operations Team designs, implements, and manages school-level operations and support. We are the nerve centre of the company. Certain aspects of what we do originate in other departments or teams from Academics, Schools, Leadership Development, Finance or People but end with Operations. No matter how well otherdepartments may complete their individual functions, it is up to Operations to be the interface that brings all school-level support functions together.     The role of Programme Managers is a microcosm of the overarching goal of the entire Operations Team, broken down by specific functional components. Each Programme Manager has a unique sphere that s/he is responsible for owning. Within that realm of responsibility, Programme Managers identify and analyse operational needs, design strategies and processes to address these challenges, and supervise the necessary training, monitoring, and constant adjustments needed for these programmes to execute successfully.           What You will Do         Programme Managers work closely with other departments to design and run specific programmes such as but not limited to:       Project Management - from ensuring digital teacher guides are ever present on teacher tablets, to ensuring supplies in classes are delivered on time and accounted for.

Ideal candidates should have experience in Operations: managing projects, identifying business challenges through data and observation, creating solutions for these issues, and overseeing an operational programme at a start-up company or executing on multiple programs at an established firm.         Persistent and versatile in getting things done and a track record achieving success. You must be determined to achieve; we have a large mission. Don t accept what has been done before and eager to challenge the status quo.         Work experience developing and managing a culture of total focus on customer satisfaction         Excellent written and verbal communication skills         Excellent organizational, leadership, analytical problem solving and strategic thinking skills         High integrity with zero tolerance for any unethical business practices     You re also        A detailed doer    You have a track record of getting things done. You re organized and responsive. You take ownership of every idea you touch and execute it to a fine level of detail, setting targets, engaging others, and doing whatever it takes to get the job done. You can multi-task dozens of such projects at once and never lose sight of the details. Likely, you have some experience in a start-up or other rapid-growth company.           A networking mastermind    You excel at meeting new people and turning them into advocates. You communicate in a clear, conscientious, and effective way in both written and oral speech.

A relentless advocate    The children we serve and teachers we empower never leave your mind. You know them, get them, have shared a meal with them (or would be happy to in the future). You would never shrink back from shaking a parent s hand or picking up a crying child, no matter what the person was wearing or looked like. Every decision you make considers their benefit, experience,    and value.           A malleable learner    You believe you can always do better. You welcome constructive criticism and provide it freely to others. You know you only get better tomorrow when others point out where you ve missed things or failed today.           A data-driven decision-maker    When making decisions, you don t rely on your intuition alone. You collect data, you analyze it and make decisions with clear justifications.           A curious investigator    You ask why a lot. You don t just take what you see and accept it. You wonder why it is that way, and are aware that the world we see is created by human choices and actions and it could be different. You wonder, and see the world as wonderful even when you want to change a part of it that is unjust.
