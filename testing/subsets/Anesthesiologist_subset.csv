Anesthesiologist and Critical Care Intensivist,"Role & responsibilities     In general, an anesthesiologist is a medical doctor who cares for a patient before, during and immediately following a surgical or medical procedure by administering appropriate anesthesia and monitoring the patient for reactions and complications, and to ensure comfort and manage pain. An anesthesiologist meets with the patient prior to the procedure to evaluate the patient's condition and review their medical history. The anesthesiologist also explains the process so the patient knows what to expect. During the procedure, the anesthesiologist carefully monitors the patient's vital signs and comfort and makes the appropriate adjustments in anesthesia. Following the procedure, the anesthesiologist continues to monitor the patient's vitals and may be involved in management of pain. Working in Anesthesiology An anesthesiologist's job description is not limited to a traditional surgical setting in a hospital or medical center. Today, anesthesiologists have many options available to them, including work in dental offices, outpatient surgical centers, labor and delivery units (administering epidural), pain management clinics, critical and intensive care units (stabilizing a patient's condition), teaching and research. Many anesthesiologists report an extreme sense of satisfaction with the profession. They are able to become intimately involved in the care of patients and are instrumental in relieving pain and restoring health. Anesthesiologists can experience a high level of social interaction with patients and their families, and enjoy a great degree of camaraderie with their partners on the medical team. Administers Anesthetics Before surgery, anesthesiologists review the patient's medical history to determine any issues that might be encountered during the procedure. Based on the patient's history and the procedure  to be performed, anesthesiologists decide on the best method to sedate the patient. When patient's arrives in the operating room, the anesthesiologist administers the anesthetic in one of three forms 3-a regional anesthetic, which numbs a specific portion of the body; a local, which blocks sensations in a smaller area; or a general anesthetic, which renders the patient unconscious. As procedures progress, anesthesiologists may need to make adjustments to ensure that patients remain comfortable, Monitors Patient Anesthesiologists have the primary responsibility for monitoring the patient's vital signs during surgery. In addition to basic measurements, such as pulse, blood pressure and temperature, anesthesiologists also measure the patient's respiration. If the patient is under a general anesthetic, the anesthesiologist measures the volume the patient inhales and the carbon dioxide level exhaled. During some procedures, the anesthesiologist must also monitor the volume of blood being pumped by the heart, nerve functions or the blood pressure inside the patient's lungs. If the procedure requires the use of special monitors, such as arterial catheters, the anesthesiologist is typically responsible for placing them. Anesthesiologists also ensure that patients remain in the proper position, such as keeping the patient's head aligned during neck surgery.  In case of any query please call Mr Rawat 9910168970.
