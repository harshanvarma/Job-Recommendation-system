Experience translating instructional content a plus,"                                           The Manager provides hands-on daily leadership and support to a team of content writers within Instructional Design department. Reporting to and working very closely with the Deputy Managing Editor, the Manager enables the success of the Instructional Design department by building a strong team, while working on a wide range of projects and initiatives related to print product quality, project management, people management, and department culture.         The Kigali-based Manager will have two core focuses - creation of French-language programme materials and effective translation of existing English-language lessons into French. The first focus will involve the writing of lessons and textbook content based on effective course scope and sequences. The second focus will involve the review of translations from an external firm, ensuring quality assurance AND closing any remaining gaps on partial translation.           Manage your team of 6 writers and 1 proofreader as they create assessments, lessons, textbooks, and other French-language instructional materials       Collaborate with other Academics Group members and government stakeholders to improve assessment quality     Provide team members with detailed feedback and coaching - especially on product quality - on a weekly basis      Manage product flow - ensuring that all content is created on time and high quality       In this deadline-driven environment, finding the balance between speed and precision is key. You ll need to be comfortable telling your team that they aren t meeting deadlines, and then help them find a way to do so, all the while ensuring the lessons are high quality. Feedback will reach your team at different intervals, and you ll need to figure out how to respond to it. At times, the projects your team is working on will need to change; your job will be to keep everyone on the same page and steadily moving forward, even when unexpected challenges arise.       Pitch in where needed on miscellaneous projects to help with other academics departments or other instructional design teams      A minimum of 5 years experience in education, educational publishing, or a related field.     Desire to manage a team; previous management experience strongly preferred     Flexible, willing to jump in and help wherever necessary, no matter how big or small the task     Self-motivated and comfortable creating solutions without a lot of support or structure     Comfortable working in a demanding and sometimes high-stress environment       A detailed doer    You have a track record of getting things done. You re organized and responsive. You take ownership of every idea you touch and execute it to a fine level of detail, setting targets, engaging others, and doing whatever it takes to get the job done. You can multi-task dozens of such projects at once and never lose sight of the details. Likely, you have some experience in a start-up or other rapid-growth company.     A networking mastermind    You excel at meeting new people and turning them into advocates. You communicate in a clear, conscientious, and effective way in both written and oral speech. You can influence strangers in the course of a single conversation. Allies and colleagues will go to bat for your ideas. You have an existing network from prior experience in the country, preferably in the regulatory, education, or business sectors.     A creative problem-solver    Growing any business from scratch comes with massive and constant challenges. On top of that, NewGlobe works in often fragile, sometimes volatile low-resource communities and with complex government systems. You need to be flexible and ready to get everything done effectively, quickly, and affordably with the materials at hand.     A relentless advocate :    The children we serve and teachers we empower never leave your mind. You know them, get them, have shared a meal with them (or would be happy to in the future). You would never shrink back from shaking a parent s hand or picking up a crying child, no matter what the person was wearing or looked like. Every decision you make considers their benefit, experience,            and value.     A malleable learner :    You believe you can always do better. You welcome constructive criticism and provide it freely to others. You know you only get better tomorrow when others point out where you ve missed things or failed today.       A curious investigator : You ask why a lot. You don t just take what you see and accept it.        Y     ou wonder why it is that way, and are aware that the world we see is created by human choices and actions and it could be different.        You wonder, and see the world as wonderful even when you want to change a part of it that is unjust.
