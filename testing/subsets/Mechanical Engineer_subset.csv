Mechanical Engineer,"   Mechanical site engineers, also known as field engineers, are responsible for making sure all machinery on a given project is constructed and installed correctly. Usually, these projects are commercial construction projects and involve HVAC systems. Mechanical site engineers can also find employment in the medical and manufacturing industries, as both of these industries require a lot of machinery. Mechanical site engineers spend a majority of their shift on the site of their current project. They are the engineers responsible for bringing the plans outlined in blueprints to life. This role is a full-time position that usually includes weekends off.       Mechanical site engineers delegate tasks to laborers, plumbers, masons, and lower-level engineering technicians. Since some projects are completed outdoors, mechanical site engineers have to prepare for the elements.     Mechanical Site Engineer Duties and Responsibilities     A mechanical site engineers duties and responsibilities vary slightly depending on the industry. We analyzed mechanical site engineer job descriptions to come up with the following list of core duties and responsibilities:         Analyze and Interpret Project Blueprints         Mechanical site engineers dont have to create blueprints often, but they do have to interpret blueprints created by CAD software on a daily basis. They can conceptualize which tasks need to be done in which order to make the blueprint a reality.         Facilitate Construction and Installation of Machine Components         While they don t do much of the actual building themselves, mechanical site engineers are heavily involved in the construction and installation of machine components. This can mean creating machinery from scratch or installing a component as part of a repair.         Test Machine Components for Functionality         Depending on one s industry, there are specific tests for each kind of machinery. It is the responsibility of the mechanical site engineer to run these tests before signing off on completion. If something doesn t perform as expected, he or she is responsible for diagnosing and fixing the problem.         Delegate Tasks to Various Project Employees         Mechanical site engineers are part project manager; they delegate tasks to laborers and technicians, providing guidance as these workers complete their tasks.         Ensure Project is Completed on Time and Budget         Project stakeholders hate when a project costs more time or money than was originally estimated. It is up to the mechanical site engineer to make sure all the mechanical aspects of the project are completed as efficiently as possible.

Mechanical Engineer,"   Mechanical site engineers, also known as field engineers, are responsible for making sure all machinery on a given project is constructed and installed correctly. Usually, these projects are commercial construction projects and involve HVAC systems. Mechanical site engineers can also find employment in the medical and manufacturing industries, as both of these industries require a lot of machinery. Mechanical site engineers spend a majority of their shift on the site of their current project. They are the engineers responsible for bringing the plans outlined in blueprints to life. This role is a full-time position that usually includes weekends off.       Mechanical site engineers delegate tasks to laborers, plumbers, masons, and lower-level engineering technicians. Since some projects are completed outdoors, mechanical site engineers have to prepare for the elements.     Mechanical Site Engineer Duties and Responsibilities     A mechanical site engineers duties and responsibilities vary slightly depending on the industry. We analyzed mechanical site engineer job descriptions to come up with the following list of core duties and responsibilities:         Analyze and Interpret Project Blueprints         Mechanical site engineers dont have to create blueprints often, but they do have to interpret blueprints created by CAD software on a daily basis. They can conceptualize which tasks need to be done in which order to make the blueprint a reality.         Facilitate Construction and Installation of Machine Components         While they don t do much of the actual building themselves, mechanical site engineers are heavily involved in the construction and installation of machine components. This can mean creating machinery from scratch or installing a component as part of a repair.         Test Machine Components for Functionality         Depending on one s industry, there are specific tests for each kind of machinery. It is the responsibility of the mechanical site engineer to run these tests before signing off on completion. If something doesn t perform as expected, he or she is responsible for diagnosing and fixing the problem.         Delegate Tasks to Various Project Employees         Mechanical site engineers are part project manager; they delegate tasks to laborers and technicians, providing guidance as these workers complete their tasks.         Ensure Project is Completed on Time and Budget         Project stakeholders hate when a project costs more time or money than was originally estimated. It is up to the mechanical site engineer to make sure all the mechanical aspects of the project are completed as efficiently as possible.
