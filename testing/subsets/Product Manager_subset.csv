PM - Mobile Consumer Tech,"   You optimize for moving fast and getting features out to users quickly. You understand the balance of building something usable, but not perfect. You prefer iterating on designs as users are using them rather than obsessing over details in Sketch or Figma.           You move with speed.       You move incredibly fast, making decisions and overcoming obstacles with speed. You are not afraid of jumping into the code base or writing SQL queries to increase velocity on the team.                 You think about the big picture and dig into the details.        You think about the overall product, the brand, and most importantly, the user from ideation to ship. You effortlessly navigate between thinking about the why the what, to the details behind how we build.           You are collaborative and low ego.     You don t care or remember who came up with the best idea. Engineers, product managers, and execs all love working with you because you make them all feel heard and you re able to find a middle ground in dissenting opinions.             Learning makes you happy       . You approach life with a beginner s mind and with deep curiosity. You may already be following the startup ecosystem. You tinker with the latest design tools even if you re faster and more comfortable using Sketch or Figma. You are constantly interested in improving your skills as a product builder and technologist, learning from your team, users, and design community. Inside and outside of work, you ask for feedback continuously, listen intently, launch quickly, test hypotheses and are constantly iterating.               The nitty-gritty stuff that you probably have on your LinkedIn but don t define who you are:           Track record of shipping web and/or mobile apps that users love.

We re a small, nimble team, and everyone pitches in to make our team successful.             That s not my part of my job is a sentence you find yourself saying often                  As a Product Manager, you will help us build an Infinyte offering that understands the real problems our members face, delivers powerful and engaging solutions, and helps them progress further in their wealth-creation journey. This means (with heavy collaboration from other teams) developing new solutions and experiences and linking together the diverse ways members can solve problems. The scope spans from discovery and navigation, through activation, feature retention, satisfaction, and more. You will likely leave an imprint on all core surface areas of our product. This is a big bet for the business and industry, but if done well we believe we can truly transform our members wealth-creation journies and careers.                 Youll be joining as part of the foundational team of an early-stage startup. Which means you ll work cross-functionally to identify opportunities that create value, design, develop, and launch product features, and gather both quantitative and qualitative learnings.
