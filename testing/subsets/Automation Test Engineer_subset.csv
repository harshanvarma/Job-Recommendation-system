Mobile automation - API  / UI automation- Professional,"API Automation: Definition: API (Application Programming Interface) automation involves testing the backend services and functionality of a mobile application programmatically. Purpose: API automation verifies that the backend services are functioning correctly, handling requests, and returning the expected responses. Tools: Common tools for API automation include Postman, REST Assured (for Java), Axios (for JavaScript), and Retrofit (for Android). Test Cases: API automation test cases validate endpoints, request parameters, response codes, response payloads, error handling, and authentication mechanisms. Frameworks: API automation can be performed using various testing frameworks such as TestNG, JUnit, Mocha, or Jest. UI Automation: Definition: UI (User Interface) automation involves testing the user interface and interactions of a mobile application programmatically. Purpose: UI automation verifies that the user interface elements are displayed correctly, respond to user interactions, and navigate the application as expected. Tools: Common tools for UI automation include Appium, Espresso (for Android), XCUITest (for iOS), and Detox. Test Cases: UI automation test cases validate UI elements, navigation flows, user inputs, gestures, and screen transitions. Frameworks: UI automation can be performed using various testing frameworks such as Selenium, WebDriverIO, XCTest, or XCTestUI. Integration of API and UI Automation: Combining Both: In many cases, mobile automation involves integrating both API and UI automation to achieve comprehensive test coverage. End-to-End Testing: End-to-end testing scenarios can be automated to simulate real user interactions, starting from API requests and responses to UI interactions and validations. Data Flow Testing: Data flow between the backend API and frontend UI can be verified through automated test scenarios, ensuring data consistency and integrity. Challenges and Considerations: Platform Specifics: Different mobile platforms (Android and iOS) may require platform-specific tools and frameworks for automation. Device Fragmentation: Testing across various devices, screen sizes, and OS versions can be challenging and may require device farms or cloud-based testing services. Test Environment Setup: Setting up test environments with mock servers, test data, and device emulators/simulators can be time-consuming but is crucial for reliable automation.

Mobile automation - API  / UI automation- Professional,"API Automation: Definition: API (Application Programming Interface) automation involves testing the backend services and functionality of a mobile application programmatically. Purpose: API automation verifies that the backend services are functioning correctly, handling requests, and returning the expected responses. Tools: Common tools for API automation include Postman, REST Assured (for Java), Axios (for JavaScript), and Retrofit (for Android). Test Cases: API automation test cases validate endpoints, request parameters, response codes, response payloads, error handling, and authentication mechanisms. Frameworks: API automation can be performed using various testing frameworks such as TestNG, JUnit, Mocha, or Jest. UI Automation: Definition: UI (User Interface) automation involves testing the user interface and interactions of a mobile application programmatically. Purpose: UI automation verifies that the user interface elements are displayed correctly, respond to user interactions, and navigate the application as expected. Tools: Common tools for UI automation include Appium, Espresso (for Android), XCUITest (for iOS), and Detox. Test Cases: UI automation test cases validate UI elements, navigation flows, user inputs, gestures, and screen transitions. Frameworks: UI automation can be performed using various testing frameworks such as Selenium, WebDriverIO, XCTest, or XCTestUI. Integration of API and UI Automation: Combining Both: In many cases, mobile automation involves integrating both API and UI automation to achieve comprehensive test coverage. End-to-End Testing: End-to-end testing scenarios can be automated to simulate real user interactions, starting from API requests and responses to UI interactions and validations. Data Flow Testing: Data flow between the backend API and frontend UI can be verified through automated test scenarios, ensuring data consistency and integrity. Challenges and Considerations: Platform Specifics: Different mobile platforms (Android and iOS) may require platform-specific tools and frameworks for automation. Device Fragmentation: Testing across various devices, screen sizes, and OS versions can be challenging and may require device farms or cloud-based testing services. Test Environment Setup: Setting up test environments with mock servers, test data, and device emulators/simulators can be time-consuming but is crucial for reliable automation.

Sdet Automation Test Engineer,"  SDET role: Minimum experience into Automation is 3 years (includes script development and troubleshooting), which will help the candidate to have better understanding/exposure on Basic Programming Concepts (Access Modifiers/loops/conditions, methods, arrays, exception handling),OOPS concepts, Collection Frameworks (advanced like Array list, Hashmap, Hashset, Dictionary etc.,) Script synchronization techniques (like waits to ensure less scripts failures), Locators (basically id, name anyone can use but expectation is to create Xpaths using sibling concepts, dynamic texts based Xpaths, CSS selectors etc.,). Version Control System like Git is used by client and the candidate should have good understanding of the commands , if there is a situation where they need to work through cmd (instead of the features provided in Visual Studio or Eclipse) and Conflict management in case of code check-in. For API testing when manual is considered , the client uses Postman(validation of endpoint URLs) and Swagger( Documentation/ reference) tool where in the candidate should be aware of different Authorization Techniques, HTTP methods(CRUD) and Status codes based on the method/ in case of errors for both client/server. API Automation is again a different case where RestSharp along with BDD Specflow is used and it is good to have . Db testing is writing simple queries (with joins) based on project needs to join 3 or more tables and extract data to validate. Good communication skills(both written/oral) are mandatory for them to handle the calls/questions from client independently. SDET Lead: Along with the above details a SDET lead should have: Good understanding of Design Patterns like Singleton, SOLID Principles along with POM . Experience in Core Framework design and development from scratch (at least in one or two projects) . Should be able to handle code reviews for the team and mentor the team on technical aspects. Apart from the above, the criteria we look while screening the profile for initial round of interview: Candidate should have good experience to technical stack like Java/C# with BDD framework for both UI and API Automation. Tools/Technologies like Javascript,Playwright etc., is given lesser priority. Profiles with multiple company shifts in less time is not considered for initial level as we feel they will not be able to take ownership of the work. A big NO for candidates who take online help during interviews (for coding exercise given) who project more than 3 years but still unable to come up with a simple pseudocode are poor in logical thinking.",1.60E+11,16-04-2024,15-07-2024,EducationalOccupationalCredential,48,Engineering - Software & QA,Automation Test Engineer,IT Services & Consulting,"C#, SDET, Automation Framework, API Testing, SQL",-,9am-6pm,"Full Time, Permanent",Ascendion Engineering Private Limited   ,Organization,Ascendion Engineering Private Limited   ,-,Hyderabad,Hyderabad,-,-,-,8-14 Lacs P.A ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Automation Test Engineer

For API testing when manual is considered , the client uses Postman(validation of endpoint URLs) and Swagger( Documentation/ reference) tool where in the candidate should be aware of different Authorization Techniques, HTTP methods(CRUD) and Status codes based on the method/ in case of errors for both client/server. API Automation is again a different case where RestSharp along with BDD Specflow is used and it is good to have . Db testing is writing simple queries (with joins) based on project needs to join 3 or more tables and extract data to validate. Good communication skills(both written/oral) are mandatory for them to handle the calls/questions from client independently. SDET Lead: Along with the above details a SDET lead should have: Good understanding of Design Patterns like Singleton, SOLID Principles along with POM . Experience in Core Framework design and development from scratch (at least in one or two projects) . Should be able to handle code reviews for the team and mentor the team on technical aspects. Apart from the above, the criteria we look while screening the profile for initial round of interview: Candidate should have good experience to technical stack like Java/C# with BDD framework for both UI and API Automation. Tools/Technologies like Javascript,Playwright etc., is given lesser priority. Profiles with multiple company shifts in less time is not considered for initial level as we feel they will not be able to take ownership of the work. A big NO for candidates who take online help during interviews (for coding exercise given) who project more than 3 years but still unable to come up with a simple pseudocode are poor in logical thinking.",1.60E+11,16-04-2024,15-07-2024,EducationalOccupationalCredential,48,Engineering - Software & QA,Automation Test Engineer,IT Services & Consulting,"C#, SDET, Automation Framework, API Testing, SQL",-,9am-6pm,"Full Time, Permanent",Ascendion Engineering Private Limited   ,Organization,Ascendion Engineering Private Limited   ,-,Bengaluru,Bengaluru,-,-,-,8-14 Lacs P.A ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Automation Test Engineer

API Automation is again a different case where RestSharp along with BDD Specflow is used and it is good to have . Db testing is writing simple queries (with joins) based on project needs to join 3 or more tables and extract data to validate. Good communication skills(both written/oral) are mandatory for them to handle the calls/questions from client independently. SDET Lead: Along with the above details a SDET lead should have: Good understanding of Design Patterns like Singleton, SOLID Principles along with POM . Experience in Core Framework design and development from scratch (at least in one or two projects) . Should be able to handle code reviews for the team and mentor the team on technical aspects. Apart from the above, the criteria we look while screening the profile for initial round of interview: Candidate should have good experience to technical stack like Java/C# with BDD framework for both UI and API Automation. Tools/Technologies like Javascript,Playwright etc., is given lesser priority. Profiles with multiple company shifts in less time is not considered for initial level as we feel they will not be able to take ownership of the work. A big NO for candidates who take online help during interviews (for coding exercise given) who project more than 3 years but still unable to come up with a simple pseudocode are poor in logical thinking.",1.60E+11,16-04-2024,15-07-2024,EducationalOccupationalCredential,48,Engineering - Software & QA,Automation Test Engineer,IT Services & Consulting,"C#, SDET, Automation Framework, API Testing, SQL",-,9am-6pm,"Full Time, Permanent",Ascendion Engineering Private Limited   ,Organization,Ascendion Engineering Private Limited   ,-,Pune,Pune,-,-,-,8-14 Lacs P.A ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Automation Test Engineer

Automation Testing (Selenium+Java)- Professional,"Automation testing using Selenium with Java involves using Selenium WebDriver, a popular automation tool, along with Java programming language to automate web application testing. Here's an overview of how to perform automation testing with Selenium and Java: Setup Environment: Install Java Development Kit (JDK) on your system and set up Java environment variables. Download and install an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA for Java development. Download Selenium WebDriver Java bindings and configure them in your project. Create a Maven Project (Optional): If you're using Maven as a build automation tool, create a Maven project and add dependencies for Selenium WebDriver and any additional libraries you'll need for testing. Write Test Scripts: Create Java classes to write test scripts using Selenium WebDriver API. Use WebDriver methods to interact with web elements such as buttons, links, input fields, and dropdowns. Write test assertions using TestNG or JUnit frameworks to verify expected outcomes and actual results. Implement Page Object Model (POM): Organize your test scripts using the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern to improve code maintainability and reusability. Create separate Java classes for each web page or component of your application, encapsulating the page-specific elements and actions within these classes. Handle Synchronization and Waits: Use implicit and explicit waits to handle synchronization issues and ensure that WebDriver waits for the expected conditions before performing actions on web elements. Implement waits for page loads, element visibility, element presence, and other asynchronous operations to avoid flakiness in test scripts. Implement Data-Driven Testing (Optional): Use data providers or external data sources (such as Excel sheets or CSV files) to parameterize your test scripts and execute them with different sets of test data. Implement data-driven testing to validate application behavior with various input combinations and edge cases. Execute Test Scripts: Run your Selenium test scripts locally on your development environment or integrate them with Continuous Integration (CI) servers like Jenkins, Bamboo, or Azure DevOps for automated test execution. Generate test reports using built-in reporting tools (TestNG, JUnit) or third-party reporting plugins (ExtentReports, Allure) to track test results and identify failures. Implement Cross-Browser Testing (Optional): Use Selenium Grid or cloud-based testing platforms (such as BrowserStack or Sauce Labs) to perform cross-browser testing across different web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, etc.). Write test scripts that are compatible with multiple browsers and handle browser-specific behaviors and capabilities. Implement Test Frameworks and Utilities (Optional): Use testing frameworks and utilities such as TestNG, JUnit, Apache POI (for Excel integration), Apache Commons IO (for file handling), and Log4j (for logging) to enhance the robustness and functionality of your test automation framework. Maintain Test Codebase: Regularly review and refactor test code to improve readability, maintainability, and performance. Update test scripts as needed to accommodate changes in application features, UI elements, or business requirements.",1.60E+11,16-04-2024,15-07-2024,EducationalOccupationalCredential,60,Engineering - Software & QA,Automation Test Engineer,Recruitment / Staffing,"Automation Testing, Apache POI, Jenkins, Java, JUnit, TestNG, Selenium, Bamboo, Azure DevOps",-,9am-6pm,"Full Time, Permanent",Net2Source LLP,Organization,Net2Source LLP,-,"Hyderabad, Chennai, Bengaluru","Hyderabad, Chennai, Bengaluru",-,-,-,Not disclosed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Automation Test Engineer

Automation Testing (Selenium+Java)- Professional,"Automation testing using Selenium with Java involves using Selenium WebDriver, a popular automation tool, along with Java programming language to automate web application testing. Here's an overview of how to perform automation testing with Selenium and Java: Setup Environment: Install Java Development Kit (JDK) on your system and set up Java environment variables. Download and install an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA for Java development. Download Selenium WebDriver Java bindings and configure them in your project. Create a Maven Project (Optional): If you're using Maven as a build automation tool, create a Maven project and add dependencies for Selenium WebDriver and any additional libraries you'll need for testing. Write Test Scripts: Create Java classes to write test scripts using Selenium WebDriver API. Use WebDriver methods to interact with web elements such as buttons, links, input fields, and dropdowns. Write test assertions using TestNG or JUnit frameworks to verify expected outcomes and actual results. Implement Page Object Model (POM): Organize your test scripts using the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern to improve code maintainability and reusability. Create separate Java classes for each web page or component of your application, encapsulating the page-specific elements and actions within these classes. Handle Synchronization and Waits: Use implicit and explicit waits to handle synchronization issues and ensure that WebDriver waits for the expected conditions before performing actions on web elements. Implement waits for page loads, element visibility, element presence, and other asynchronous operations to avoid flakiness in test scripts. Implement Data-Driven Testing (Optional): Use data providers or external data sources (such as Excel sheets or CSV files) to parameterize your test scripts and execute them with different sets of test data. Implement data-driven testing to validate application behavior with various input combinations and edge cases. Execute Test Scripts: Run your Selenium test scripts locally on your development environment or integrate them with Continuous Integration (CI) servers like Jenkins, Bamboo, or Azure DevOps for automated test execution. Generate test reports using built-in reporting tools (TestNG, JUnit) or third-party reporting plugins (ExtentReports, Allure) to track test results and identify failures. Implement Cross-Browser Testing (Optional): Use Selenium Grid or cloud-based testing platforms (such as BrowserStack or Sauce Labs) to perform cross-browser testing across different web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, etc.). Write test scripts that are compatible with multiple browsers and handle browser-specific behaviors and capabilities. Implement Test Frameworks and Utilities (Optional): Use testing frameworks and utilities such as TestNG, JUnit, Apache POI (for Excel integration), Apache Commons IO (for file handling), and Log4j (for logging) to enhance the robustness and functionality of your test automation framework. Maintain Test Codebase: Regularly review and refactor test code to improve readability, maintainability, and performance. Update test scripts as needed to accommodate changes in application features, UI elements, or business requirements.",1.60E+11,16-04-2024,15-07-2024,EducationalOccupationalCredential,60,Engineering - Software & QA,Automation Test Engineer,Recruitment / Staffing,"Automation Testing, Apache POI, Jenkins, Java, JUnit, TestNG, Selenium, Bamboo, Azure DevOps",-,9am-6pm,"Full Time, Permanent",Net2Source LLP,Organization,Net2Source LLP,-,Pune,Pune,-,-,-,Not disclosed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Automation Test Engineer
