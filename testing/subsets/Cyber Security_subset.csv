ColorTokens - Cyber Security RFP Engineer,"About ColorTokens : Over the last three decades, organizations globally have spent billions of dollars in cybersecurity, focussing specifically on ""perimeter"" security. Perimeter solutions such as firewalls and user access (ZTNA) focus on keeping the bad actors out. However, with perimeters dissolving with remote work and cloud migration, they continues to lose effectiveness making them easy to breach. Perimeter security provides no protection within the organization's internal networks which carry up to 85% of all traffic. Lack of internal controls provide ample real estate for attackers to lurk and carry out damaging attacks. This is where ColorTokens comes in. With its industry-recognized Zero Trust Microsegmentation platform, ColorTokens delivers deep visibility and granular security control across the entire enterprise. Security teams can create a Zero Trust Architecture based on principle of least-privilege from data center, to cloud, to OT and IoT infrastructure by ""seeing"" and controlling every traffic flow.
