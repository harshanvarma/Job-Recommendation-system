Sr . Solution Architect," The solutions architect is accountable for proactively and holistically leading or supporting enterprise architecture activities for creating deliverables that guide the developing direction for managing a portfolio of solutions in response to disruptive forces, and driving achieving targeted business outcomes. Solutions include systems (including applications, technologies, processes and information), shared infrastructure services and shared application services. Solutions architects provide the necessary leadership, analysis and design tasks related to developing an enterprises solutions architecture.      This individual creates deliverables that help develop a direction for managing the organizations portfolio of ""to be"" and ""as is"" solutions including systems (meaning not just applications, but also processes and information), shared infrastructure services, and shared application services and components to better match targeted business outcome objectives. Solutions architecture is sometimes used interchangeably with applications and infrastructure architecture.      However, both of the aforementioned typically fall under the purview of the solutions architect. Application architecture is a subset of solutions architecture. Its the discipline that guides application design and defines application architecture paradigms, such as service-oriented architecture (SOA), principles that influence design decisions and patterns that provide proven design solutions. Solutions architects leverage and use technology solutions to enable the organizations future-state business capabilities that, in turn, drive the organizations targeted outcomes. They facilitate and orchestrate the delivery of targeted business outcomes.       Scope of Activities:     Understand business drivers and capabilities (future and current state) and determine corresponding enterprise system designs and change requirements to drive the organizations targeted business outcomes.   Design and lead the implementation of a solutions architecture across a group of specific business applications or technologies based on enterprise business strategy, business capabilities and requirements.   Manage and develop the architecture for a broader scope of projects, working closely with application developers that manage and design architecture for a single project or initiative.   Provide consulting support to application architects/developers within projects to ensure the project is aligned with the overall enterprise architecture.       Monitor the current-state solution portfolio to identify deficiencies through the ageing of the technologies used by the application or misalignment with business requirements.   Understand technology trends and the practical application of existing, new, and emerging technologies to enable new and evolving business and operating models.   Understand, advocate and augment the principles of information technology strategies.   Analyze the business-IT environment (run, grow and transform the business) to detect critical deficiencies, and recommend solutions for improvement (systems of record, differentiation and innovation).   Analyze the technology industry, competitors and market trends, and determine their potential impact on the enterprise.       Define the principles, guidelines, standards and solution patterns to ensure solution decisions are aligned with the enterprises future state architecture ision.   Design and direct the governance activities to ensure solutions architecture assurance and compliance.   Develop a roadmap for the evolution of the enterprise application portfolio from the current to the future state.   Facilitate the evaluation and selection of software product standards and services, as well as the design of standard and custom software configurations.   Consult with application and infrastructure development projects to fit systems or infrastructure to architecture, and identify when it is necessary to modify projects to accommodate the solutions architecture.   Identify the organizational impact (for example, on skills, processes, structures or culture) and financial impact of the solutions architecture.       Document all solution architecture design and analysis work.

IAM Administrator,"Skill Set:  Develop self-hosted IAM automations for use with Orion project to improve Security delivery times. AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a crucial service within Amazon Web Services (AWS) that enables you to control access to your AWS resources. To work effectively with AWS IAM, we need a combination of skill and knowledge. Here are the key skill requirements for AWS IAM:  1. Understanding of AWS Basics: Before diving into IAM, you should have a foundational understanding of AWS services, infrastructure, and cloud computing concepts. Familiarity with AWS services like EC2, S3, and RDS is essential, as IAM controls access to these resources.  2. IAM Concepts: You should have a solid grasp of IAM concepts, including users, groups, roles, policies, permissions, and authentication mechanisms. Understand the difference between identity-based and resource-based policies.  3. Policy Language: Learn AWS policy language, which is written in JSON. You should be able to create, modify, and evaluate IAM policies. Understand the different policy elements like actions, resources, conditions, and effect (Allow/Deny).  4. User and Group Management: Be able to create and manage IAM users and groups. Understand how to assign permissions to users and groups using policies. Familiarity with the concept of least privilege is crucial to ensure security.  5. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Understand the use of IAM roles and how they differ from users and groups. Roles are often used for cross-account access and temporary permissions.  6. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Know how to configure and enforce MFA for IAM users, adding an extra layer of security.  7. Identity Federation: Understand how to set up identity federation with external identity providers (e.g., Active Directory, SAML, OpenID Connect) to allow users to access AWS resources using their existing corporate credentials.  8. Access Key Management: Learn how to create, rotate, and manage access keys for programmatic access. Be aware of the best practices for securing access keys.  9. Auditing and Monitoring: Be familiar with AWS CloudTrail, which records API actions for auditing purposes. Understand how to use AWS CloudWatch for monitoring IAM-related events and alarms.  10. Security Best Practices: Stay up-to-date with AWS security best practices and recommended IAM configurations to enhance the security of your AWS environment.  11. IAM Policies for Services: Understand how IAM policies apply to various AWS services. Some services have resource-level policies that are specific to them.  12. Scripting and SDKs: If you work with IAM programmatically, have proficiency in scripting languages (e.g., Python, Boto3) and AWS SDKs to automate IAM tasks.  13. Troubleshooting: Develop troubleshooting skills to diagnose and resolve IAM-related issues effectively. AWS provides logs and tools to help with this.  14. Compliance and Governance: Understand how IAM fits into AWS compliance frameworks and governance practices. Ensure that IAM policies align with organizational compliance requirements.  15. Communication: Good communication skills are essential, especially if you are responsible for implementing IAM policies across a team or organization. Explain IAM concepts and best practices to colleagues and stakeholders.  16. Continuous Learning: The cloud and security landscapes are constantly evolving. Stay updated with AWS announcements, security advisories, and new IAM features to adapt and improve your IAM implementation.

Apraava Energy has a diversified and en vironment -friendly power generation portfolio of ~3000 equity MW comprising both Conventional (~2000 MW) and Renewable (~1200 MW) assets.    Apraava Energy was one of the first companies to identify the potential of renewable energy in India. The company ente red this space by building its first wind farm in 2009. Since then Apraava Energy has gradually grown its wind energy portfolio and is now spread across six states generating nearly 1,000 MW and another 250 MW of committed capacity.     ?Wind energy has been an integral part of Apraava Energy 's business strategy. It is expected to continue making a vital contribution not only to CLP's growth plans for India but also to its commitment towards reducing its CO2 emissions.    Apraava Energy forayed into solar power gen eration with a 100 MW plant in 2016 through a joint venture in Veltoor, Telangana. Apraava Energy acquired two more solar plants in 2018. In 2020, Apraava Energy increased the size of its solar energy portfolio by more than 70% by entering into an agreemen t to acquire three of its solar projects.        In line with Apraava Energy s vision of investing in a low -carbon and clean energy portfolio, Apraava Energy marked its entry into the power transmission sector in 2019 with the acquisition of 240 km transmission l ine. With this, Apraava Energy has broadened its portfolio to straddle two out of the three main segments in Indias power value chain.        The company has also built a 1,320 MW supercritical coal -fired power plant in Jhajjar, Haryana. The Jhajjar Power Plant has been commercially operational since mid -2012. It is one of the first few power plants in India to operationalize the Flue Gas Desulphurization (FGD) unit which helps reduce ~ 85% of SO2 emissions.        The plant has also won the Frost & Sullivan and TERI Ju ry Special Mention Award in 2019 for reducing its specific water consumption to 2.11 m/ MWh against a statutory limit of 3.5 m/ MWh.
