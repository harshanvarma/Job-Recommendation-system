Data Replication: You would configure and manage data replication processes using SAP Landscape Transformation Replication Server (SLT) or other data replication tools.

You would collaborate with stakeholders to define master data governance processes and establish data governance frameworks to maintain data integrity and consistency across systems. Reporting and Analytics: You would leverage SAP S/4HANA's reporting and analytics capabilities to provide stakeholders with insights into financial performance, trends, and key metrics. This may involve designing and developing custom reports, dashboards, and analytics models to support decision-making and compliance requirements. Change Management and Training: You would facilitate change management activities to help users adapt to the new SAP Central Finance solution. This includes conducting training sessions, developing training materials, and providing ongoing support to address user questions and issues.

Reporting and Analytics: You would leverage SAP S/4HANA's reporting and analytics capabilities to provide stakeholders with insights into financial performance, trends, and key metrics. This may involve designing and developing custom reports, dashboards, and analytics models to support decision-making and compliance requirements.
