Research Scientist - Kilo Lab process,"Research Scientist Chemical Development Page 1 of 5    Position Description     JOB TITLE: RESEARCH SCIENTIST   Status:  Regular Full Time      Department:  Chemical Development     SUMMARY OF FUNCTIONS   The Research Scientist is expected to demonstrate expertise in both the theoretical and practical aspects of organic chemistry. Principal responsibility is the synthesis, purification, and identification of chemical intermediates and target compounds. A major component in the scientist's performance rating will be based on productivity.   MAJOR DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES   include the following.   Other duties may be assigned.     Synthesize known compounds efficiently using literature or in-house notebook procedures.  Under supervisory direction, synthesize new compounds by making appropriate modifications of known methods. The range of reaction types handled capably by the scientist will be significant.  Purify synthesized chemicals to an appropriate degree. The scientist will be able to use the full range of chromatographic, crystallization, and distillation techniques.  Analyze and identify compounds using a good range of modern separation and spectroscopic techniques. This will include interpretation of TLC, HPLC, polarimetry, IR, and NMR spectra of moderate complexity.  Organize work time so that several reactions are run concurrently.  Use time efficiently to produce target compounds and perform other tasks.  Learn and conduct literature searches for specific target compounds, structures related to the target compound, or to determine specific conditions for compounds and reactions.  Recommend and implement methods to increase the quality of products and/or services. Keep accurate, legible and complete records of all experiments and observations.  Submit acceptable written periodic reports. Prepare summaries of experimental findings reliably and independently.  Discuss routinely with supervisor the status of assigned programs and potential problems. The latter is especially important in cases where the scientist may be unfamiliar with the reagents or conditions to be employed. Communicate orally and in writing unexpected occurrences which could adversely affect established timetables. Conduct laboratory operations in a safe manner. Maintain familiarity with the Chemical Hygiene Plan. Exhibit safety awareness and safe work practices Follow responsible actions regarding chemical disposal. Maintain compliance with all regulations as per the prevailing safety guidelines and laws. Modify reaction conditions in order to improve yields (design of new or alternate reaction sequences is not a normal expectation, but will enhance the performance evaluation of the scientist). Practice preventive maintenance on laboratory equipment and replenish laboratory supplies as stock depletes to prevent laboratory down-time. Manage workload and time to enable the incumbent to perform multiple projects effectively, and ensure all necessary paperwork is completed on a timely basis. Volunteer to assist with tasks not directly related to specific projects. Participate in self-development activities. Perform other related duties as may be reasonably assigned in the course of business. The Research Scientist is encouraged to display a degree of professionalism reflected in part by increasing the scientist's knowledge of organic chemistry theory and practice through reading scientific journals and texts at times beyond the ""normal"" working hours.  QUALIFICATIONS   To perform this job successfully, an individual must be able to perform each essential duty satisfactorily.   The requirements listed below are representative of the knowledge, skill, and/or ability required.   Reasonable accommodations may be made to enable individuals with disabilities to perform the essential functions.   Education and/or Experience   Masters Degree with major in organic chemistry  4 to 8 years industrial experience in PR&D/Kilo scale The candidate must possess a strong background in the theory and practical details of synthetic organic chemistry with a thorough understanding of modern synthetic methods and reaction mechanisms.  Must have undergone Chemical Hygiene training Good verbal and written communication skills  Must have a desire to work in a collaborative team environment  Good presentation and interpersonal skills Language/Communication Skills  Ability to read and interpret documents such as safety rules, operating and maintenance instructions, and procedure manuals. Ability to write routine reports and correspondence.
