GCP Cloud Engineer,"As a GCP (Google Cloud Platform) Cloud Engineer, your role revolves around designing, implementing, and managing cloud-based solutions on Google Cloud Platform. Here's an overview of your responsibilities and tasks: Cloud Architecture Design: You design scalable, secure, and cost-effective cloud architectures on GCP to meet the requirements of your clients or organization. This involves selecting appropriate GCP services and resources such as compute instances, storage solutions, databases, networking components, and security services. Infrastructure as Code (IaC): You utilize infrastructure as code tools and frameworks such as Terraform, Google Cloud Deployment Manager, or Google Cloud SDK to automate the provisioning and management of GCP resources. This enables infrastructure configurations to be defined, version-controlled, and deployed programmatically. Compute and Networking: You deploy and manage compute instances (VMs), containers (using Google Kubernetes Engine - GKE), and serverless applications (using Google Cloud Functions or Cloud Run) on GCP. You configure and optimize networking components such as Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), subnets, routes, load balancers, and VPN connections to ensure secure and efficient communication between cloud resources. Storage and Databases: You leverage GCP storage services such as Google Cloud Storage (GCS), Cloud SQL, Cloud Spanner, Bigtable, and Firestore to store and manage data effectively. You design and implement scalable, highly available, and durable storage solutions to meet the performance and reliability requirements of your applications. Security and Identity Management: You implement security best practices and controls to protect GCP resources and data from unauthorized access, data breaches, and other security threats. This includes configuring identity and access management (IAM) policies, encryption, key management, logging, and monitoring solutions to ensure compliance with security standards and regulations. Monitoring and Logging: You set up monitoring and logging solutions on GCP using tools such as Google Cloud Monitoring, Stackdriver Logging, and Stackdriver Trace to track the performance, availability, and health of cloud resources and applications. You create custom dashboards, alerts, and notifications to proactively detect and respond to incidents. Deployment and Automation: You build CI/CD pipelines to automate the deployment, testing, and delivery of software applications on GCP. This involves integrating version control systems (e.g., Git), build tools (e.g., Jenkins), and artifact repositories (e.g., Google Container Registry) to enable continuous integration and continuous deployment workflows. Cost Optimization: You optimize cloud resource usage and costs on GCP by implementing cost management strategies such as rightsizing instances, using preemptible VMs, leveraging auto-scaling capabilities, and analyzing billing reports and usage trends to identify opportunities for cost savings. Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity: You design and implement disaster recovery (DR) and business continuity (BC) solutions on GCP to minimize downtime and data loss in the event of outages or disasters. This may involve replicating data across multiple regions, configuring backup and restore mechanisms, and implementing failover procedures. Documentation and Knowledge Sharing: You create documentation, runbooks, and knowledge base articles to document cloud architectures, configurations, and best practices. You share your expertise and insights with colleagues and stakeholders through training sessions, workshops, and technical presentations to promote knowledge sharing and collaboration.",160000000000.0,16-04-2024,15-07-2024,EducationalOccupationalCredential,84,IT & Information Security,Cloud System Administration,Recruitment / Staffing,"GCP, Cloud SQL, Cloud Spanner, Jenkins, Networking, Cloud Architecture, CI/CD, VPC, Google Cloud Monitoring",-,9am-6pm,"Full Time, Permanent",Net2Source LLP,Organization,Net2Source LLP,-,Chennai,Chennai,-,-,-,Not disclosed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Cloud System Administration

Azure Infrastructure Engineer," 1. Configure Networks    TCP/IP inter-networking represents a heavy lift for many IT professionals because the concept is so    broad and deep. This complexity ramps up in Azure because you will never see the hardware behind    the Azure Networking Stack.    To succeed as an Azure Administrator, you need to understand required networking tasks like:    - Deploying and Configuring Virtual Networks.    - Orchestrating Routing Paths, especially in a Hybrid Cloud.    - Managing Public and Private IP addresses for your VMs and selected other Azure resources.      2. Monitor Resources And Log Analytics    You should learn how to use Log Analytics in the Azure portal to write Azure Monitor log queries.    Also, one needs to have a basic understanding of how to perform the below tasks:    - Use Log Analytics to write a simple query    - Understand the schema of your data    - Filter, sort, and group results    - Apply a time range    - Create charts    - Save and load queries    - Export and share queries      3. Compute    The Azure Administrator is most often identified with infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), which    normally boils down to running Virtual Machines (VMs) in the cloud. To that point, to be a successful    Azure Administrator, you should have familiarity with either or both of the Hypervisor platforms:    - Microsoft Hyper-V    - VMware vSphere    Some VM-related Administrative Tasks Include:    - Deploying VMs into Virtual Networks.    - Configuring VM for Optimum Cost, Performance, and Security.    - Backing up VMs and potentially providing Fail-over Recovery.    - Containers represent a newer way to virtualize services, and Docker is extremely wellrepresented in Azure. Therefore, one should understand how to deploy, manage, and monitor    containers.      4. Implement And Manage Storage          Azure provides Administrators with essentially limitless storage. You need space to store VM virtual    hard disks, Database Files, Application Data, and potentially useful data.      Furthermore, you should also study Powershell/CLI commands, which would help you to create/remove storage.

Network Security Solution,"       Once roaming users logged into the remote VPN agent, Systems were in-sync with the domain thus latest password and domain policies were fetched on the users system automatically.          As we have provided the Cloud-based solution, there was consistent security, a unified policy to roaming users and blocked intranet access to non-compliant systems.          Due to Cloud-based solutions, the customer has the flexibility to increase the users license anytime without changing any hardware.          Benefits :            As the solution is Cloud-based there is no requirement for any hardware installation or maintenance          The solution provides all the NGFW features and capabilities like;          Application and user-based Security policy          Threat prevention includes Anti-virus, Anti-spyware, Vulnerability Protection, Anti-bot          It provides Sandboxing solution which will block zero-day threat (ATP)          It provides DNS security which blocks all malicious DNS request          It provides URL filtering which helps in blocking all unwanted websites          Once users are connected to Prisma access using the agent, all the traffic will be forwarded to the Prisma access cloud and get scanned for all the above security features.          Only the intranet traffic is been forwarded to physical DC via Prisma Access for accessing the internal application          All the internet traffic goes to internet directly from Prisma Access (No Backhauling of the traffic).          Conclusion :            After installation of the Prisma access solution and applying all the security features we saw lots of users trying to visit malicious websites and malicious DNS request which were getting blocked.          We also got the complete detailed report of the same which helped the customer to check on the end system and scan it.
