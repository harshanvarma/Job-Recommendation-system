SAP EWM professional,"SAP EWM (Extended Warehouse Management) is a comprehensive software solution designed to optimize and automate warehouse and distribution center processes within organizations. As a SAP EWM consultant or professional, your role involves configuring, implementing, and supporting SAP EWM to meet the specific needs of your clients or organization. Here's an overview of your responsibilities and tasks:Solution Design and Configuration: You would collaborate with clients to understand their warehouse operations, requirements, and goals. Based on this analysis, you would design the SAP EWM solution architecture and configure the system to support warehouse processes such as inbound and outbound logistics, inventory management, storage bin management, picking, packing, and shipping.Master Data Setup: You would set up master data within SAP EWM, including product master data, storage bin configurations, warehouse structures, and handling unit profiles. This involves defining warehouse layout, storage types, storage sections, storage bins, and assigning appropriate attributes to each storage bin based on material characteristics and storage requirements.Integration: SAP EWM integrates closely with other SAP modules such as SAP ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning), SAP SCM (Supply Chain Management), SAP TM (Transportation Management), and SAP TM (Event Management), as well as with external systems such as barcode scanners, RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) systems, and material handling equipment (MHE). You would be responsible for ensuring seamless integration between SAP EWM and these systems to enable data exchange and process automation.Custom Development: While SAP EWM provides standard functionality for warehouse management processes, you may need to develop custom enhancements or interfaces to address unique business requirements. This could involve writing ABAP code, developing custom reports, or configuring custom workflows within the SAP EWM solution.User Training and Support: You would provide training and support to warehouse personnel on how to use SAP EWM effectively to perform their daily tasks. This may involve conducting training sessions, creating user documentation, and providing ongoing support to address user questions and issues.Testing and Validation: You would conduct testing and validation of the SAP EWM solution to ensure that it meets the specified requirements and functions correctly in different scenarios. This may involve unit testing, integration testing, user acceptance testing, and regression testing to identify and resolve any issues before the system goes live.Performance Optimization: You would optimize the performance of SAP EWM to ensure efficient warehouse operations and timely processing of transactions. This may involve tuning system configurations, optimizing database performance, and identifying and resolving performance bottlenecks.Continuous Improvement: After the initial implementation, you would continue to optimize and enhance the SAP EWM solution based on feedback, changing business requirements, and emerging best practices.

SAP EWM professional,"SAP EWM (Extended Warehouse Management) is a comprehensive software solution designed to optimize and automate warehouse and distribution center processes within organizations. As a SAP EWM consultant or professional, your role involves configuring, implementing, and supporting SAP EWM to meet the specific needs of your clients or organization. Here's an overview of your responsibilities and tasks:Solution Design and Configuration: You would collaborate with clients to understand their warehouse operations, requirements, and goals. Based on this analysis, you would design the SAP EWM solution architecture and configure the system to support warehouse processes such as inbound and outbound logistics, inventory management, storage bin management, picking, packing, and shipping.Master Data Setup: You would set up master data within SAP EWM, including product master data, storage bin configurations, warehouse structures, and handling unit profiles. This involves defining warehouse layout, storage types, storage sections, storage bins, and assigning appropriate attributes to each storage bin based on material characteristics and storage requirements.Integration: SAP EWM integrates closely with other SAP modules such as SAP ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning), SAP SCM (Supply Chain Management), SAP TM (Transportation Management), and SAP TM (Event Management), as well as with external systems such as barcode scanners, RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) systems, and material handling equipment (MHE). You would be responsible for ensuring seamless integration between SAP EWM and these systems to enable data exchange and process automation.Custom Development: While SAP EWM provides standard functionality for warehouse management processes, you may need to develop custom enhancements or interfaces to address unique business requirements. This could involve writing ABAP code, developing custom reports, or configuring custom workflows within the SAP EWM solution.User Training and Support: You would provide training and support to warehouse personnel on how to use SAP EWM effectively to perform their daily tasks. This may involve conducting training sessions, creating user documentation, and providing ongoing support to address user questions and issues.Testing and Validation: You would conduct testing and validation of the SAP EWM solution to ensure that it meets the specified requirements and functions correctly in different scenarios. This may involve unit testing, integration testing, user acceptance testing, and regression testing to identify and resolve any issues before the system goes live.Performance Optimization: You would optimize the performance of SAP EWM to ensure efficient warehouse operations and timely processing of transactions. This may involve tuning system configurations, optimizing database performance, and identifying and resolving performance bottlenecks.Continuous Improvement: After the initial implementation, you would continue to optimize and enhance the SAP EWM solution based on feedback, changing business requirements, and emerging best practices. This may involve conducting regular performance reviews, implementing system upgrades, and exploring opportunities for automation and process improvement.",Net2Source LLP,Mumbai,16-04-2024,15-07-2024,"Full Time, Permanent",Not disclosed,36,Recruitment / Staffing,"Any Graduate, Any Postgraduate",Other Consulting - Other,"SAP EWM, sap scm, shipping, supply chain management, warehouse operations, warehouse management, transport management, outbound logistics, inventory management, transportation",https://www.naukri.com/job-listings-sap-ewm-professional-net2source-llp-mumbai-chennai-bengaluru-3-to-8-years-160424910191,Mumbai,-,-,Consulting,1.60E+11,P.A.,-,-,-,9am-6pm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Recruitment / Staffing
