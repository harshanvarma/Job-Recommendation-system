Operations Manager - Vendor Management,"     1) Keeping track of invoices/bills:    In order to provide customers credit to purchase your product or service, and to keep record of the purchase, you will need to send customers an invoice. This should have the details of the good or service being sold, the date of purchase, the payable amount, and the timeframe within which your customer has to pay.       2) Setting reminders:    Setting reminders for your customer to make payments, and for yourself to pay you bills is crucial to making sure no payment is overdue. Piled up AR or AP is never an indicator of a smoothly running business. The longer it takes to make the payment, the longer your accounts receivable stays open, the less chance you have of getting paid.       3) Making/Receiving payments:    Making transactions is the crux of your business. Paying your bills and collecting payments from customers is how your business runs. This requires you to have a grasp of your finances, and see who owes you money and whom you owe money to.       4) Updating accounts:    Just as crucial is making sure to record all payments due or received in your accounts. This ensures you have a clear idea of your cash flow.   Simplify AR and AP process with an online accounting software    Both AR and AP are important aspects of your business functioning. Managing them however can be a bit of a hassle. Investing in an online accounting system can help with several processes involved with your AR and AP, including:       1) Invoices and bills:    Managing all your bills and invoices can be difficult. Keeping track of your invoices and bills is simpler when it s all in one convenient location. You can send invoices or record bills for every transaction you make, and schedule them to be sent automatically on a later date.       2) Reminders:    It s easy for your customer to forget about a pending payment, just as easy it is for you to forget a payment you owe to a vendor. With an accounting system, you can send reminders to your customers, as well as set reminders for yourself when it is time to pay.       3) Payments:    Most accounting systems integrate with several payment service providers to ensure you give your customer the benefit of choosing whichever payment method they prefer. This can prove to be very important when it comes to ensuring payments are made on time, every time.       4) Reports:    Several accounting systems give you access to automatically generated financial reports for all the transactions going in and out of your business.This helps you have an overall understanding of how your business is doing, and can help make some important decisions.
