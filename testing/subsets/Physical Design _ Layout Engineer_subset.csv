Engineer / Senior / Staff Physical Design Engineer,"     We are the POP Implementation team which is part of Physical Design Group(PDG) at Arm.           POP team is an experience to see the bigger picture of technical, business and problem solving aspects through the journey of building Arm CPU, GPU, NPU and Interconnect implementations. So what are the aspects we touch upon a daily basis?           We do the physical implementation of Arm s latest CPU, GPU, NPU and Interconnect IP!         We have exposure to advanced and mainstream technology nodes(3nm/5nm/7nm/12nm/22nm) across multiple foundries!         We indulge in path-finding of Performance, Power and Area(PPA) metrics using optimized recipes along with backend closure that s representative of a tape-out.         We develop physical implementation flows and exercise PPA tuning across multiple vendor based EDA flows(Cadence/Synopsys) in parallel.         We work closely with Arm sales, marketing and end customers to refine the physical IP and implementation products.         Contribute in brainstorming ideas, approaches and recipes on all products being crafted in the team.         Learn the intricacies of supporting products across different market segments like Client, Infrastructure, Automotive, IOT and Machine Learning.               Responsibilities:           You will be encouraged to build implementations of Arm CPU/GPU class designs using PDG s optimized physical IP.         The process involves RTL setup, integration of memory models, creation of floorplans and finding the rewarding recipe of synthesis / P&R flow.         The primary objective would be to optimize performance, power and area as required by the Arm IP and the associated market segment.         In terms of backend closure, you will need to take the design through STA, EM, IR drop, signoff DRC and other types of verification steps.         There are lighter aspects related to DFT(scan insertion, compression and ATPG) and Gate-level simulations to report power.         Your daily job will demand a lot of handshaking with physical IP teams who are responsible for optimized standard cell and memories.         There is a need to engage with EDA partners in an independent manner to create and deploy recipes related to EDA tools.         You will see exposure to commercial teams at Arm. This will extend to end customers also as you evolve over time.           Required Skills and Experience :           Bachelors/Masters with 3-12 years of minimum experience in Physical Design domain.
