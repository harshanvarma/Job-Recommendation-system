Senior Data Scientist - Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning,"Job   Description: We seek an experienced Senior NLP Engineer / Large Language Model Architect to lead the development and optimization of our NLP projects. The ideal candidate will be instrumental in refining our large language models, particularly focusing on areas such as pharmaceutical SOPs and research contexts. This role requires a deep understanding of NLP principles, practical experience in deploying large-scale models, and a problem-solving mindset geared towards delivering high-quality, efficient solutions. Key   Responsibilities: ??Design, develop, and refine large language models to meet specific project requirements, ensuring high quality and efficiency. ??Lead the transition and optimization of NLP models from platforms like Solr and Elasticsearch to Sinequa and Amazon SageMaker. ??Develop and implement strategies for prompt engineering, model refinement, and training pipelines to enhance model performance. ??Collaborate with internal teams and stakeholders to understand project needs, providing expert  guidance and NLP architectural advice. ??Manage the integration of knowledge graphs into NLP models to improve contextual understanding and output relevance. ??Evaluate and utilize state-of-the-art embedding vectors and encoding methods to ensure optimal model performance. ??Oversee the concept extraction and entity recognition processes, ensuring integration with existing knowledge graphs and data pipelines. ??Guide the team in the expansion and refinement of taxonomies using large language models, followed by human review for tagging accuracy. ??Drive the adoption of best practices in NLP model development, deployment, and maintenance, staying abreast of the latest industry trends and research.   Required   Skills   and   Experience: ??Advanced degree in Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence, Linguistics, or a related field. ??Extensive experience in NLP, with a strong portfolio of projects involving large language models. ??Proficiency in using platforms such as Hugging Face, Sinequa, and Amazon SageMaker for model deployment and refinement. ??Solid understanding of model training, tuning, and refinement techniques, with proven success in applying these to large-scale projects. ??Experience with knowledge graphs, entity recognition, and concept extraction technologies. ??Strong coding skills in relevant programming languages (e.g., Python) and familiarity with NLP libraries and frameworks. ??Demonstrated ability to work effectively in a fast-paced, dynamic environment, managing multiple projects simultaneously. ??Excellent problem-solving skills, with a keen eye for detail and a commitment to high-quality outcomes. ??Strong communication and collaboration skills, with the ability to convey complex technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders. Desirable   Attributes:  ??Experience in the pharmaceutical or research sectors, with an understanding of SOP's and compliance requirements. ??A pragmatic approach to project management, avoiding ""magical"" solutions and focusing on tangible results. ??The flexibility to adapt to changing project needs and the ability to guide teams through technical challenges. ??A team player attitude, with experience working in or leading multidisciplinary teams. Application   Process: Interested candidates are invited to submit a detailed resume/CV to hr@rhythmtraffic.in, along with a cover letter outlining your specific experience in NLP and large language model development, and how you can contribute to our team's success. Please include examples of past projects and their impact on the organization's goals. About   the   project   &   the   Team: We have a RAG platform. Currently, we are transitioning from Solr and Elasticsearch on Cloudera to Sinequa and SageMaker on Amazon, not by choice, but it is what it is.  We require NLP experts to handle aspects related to large language models. Deploying the models is relatively straightforward, typically done through Hugging Face, but that's not the main issue. The challenge lies in the nuances of developing high-quality large language models, including organizing prompts, refining training pipelines, and understanding when they work or fail. For instance, over the last three weeks, we attempted refinement training on pharmaceutical standard operating procedures (SOP's), which was unsuccessful. Initially, the model forgot its chat bot functionalities. After two weeks of retraining on a local cluster, the refinements on SOP's were lost again, indicating a fundamental flaw in our approach. Our NLP team suggests experimental methods based on academic papers, but we lack the luxury of time for such trials. Therefore, we have the need for experienced individuals who can provide architect-level guidance on managing multiple large language models, including those specific to SOP's and research contexts. We are developing our own large language model using our data, which we plan to utilize. We need to strategics on prompt engineering and ETL processes, and how to integrate our knowledge graph into the prompts. Currently, we're using the top embedding vector from Hugging Face for encoding, which is feasible as our beta environment only hosts 20 million records, allowing for a manageable re-encoding timeline. We aim for high-quality outcomes with our large language models, applicable universally, not just our data. We are seeking someone well-versed in the theoretical and practical aspects of NLP, capable of guiding us in refinement training, estimating costs, and expected quality improvements. The goal is to have mature, pragmatic discussions rather than rely on uncertain, ""magical"" solutions.We're in a situation, recognizing that the field attracts many who prefer experimenting with technology over delivering tangible value. We've learned that finding individuals with a comprehensive skill set is unrealistic due to the multidisciplinary nature of this field. We've shifted our strategy to engage specialists for specific phases, thereby avoiding the inefficiency of prolonged meetings. Our   requirement   is   straightforward:  an expert who can effectively deploy large language models of high quality. We're exploring various tools and methods, such as Data IKU for concept extraction and SciByte for named entity recognition (NER), supported by our knowledge graph. Our challenges include managing taxonomies, expanding synonyms with large language models, and ensuring human review for tagging accuracy during ETL. We seek a senior professional who can guide our team, which, despite some cynicism, is capable when given clear instructions. Our team, consisting of around 40-50 members, including 20 developers and 10 individuals focused on NLP, recently welcomed a new master's graduate, bringing fresh expertise to our algorithmic challenges. However, we lack comprehensive team capabilities. Our preference is for a homogeneous team, given the challenges of managing multinational teams across different time zones. Our immediate need is not for Amazon or SageMaker experts but for someone to address the core aspects of large language model applications. We consider a hybrid model, identifying an 'MVP' person for immediate needs, supported by a flexible structure that accommodates project-specific specialists. This approach is necessitated by our complex infrastructure, which requires a significant on boarding period to fully grasp. In   summary,   we   seek   a   candidate   capable   of   integrating   into   our   system,   understanding   our   sophisticated processes,   and   contributing   effectively.   This   involves   not   just   technical   skills   but   also   adapting   to   our organizational   culture   and   procedural   requirements.   The   ideal   candidate   would   be   evaluated   over   several months,   allowing   for   a   comprehensive   assessment   of   their   fit   and   contribution   to   our   objectives.",2.50E+11,25-04-2024,24-07-2024,EducationalOccupationalCredential,60,Data Science & Analytics,NLP / DL Engineering / Architect,IT Services & Consulting,"Natural Language Processing, sinequa, large language model, Elastic Search, Python, Prompt Engineering, Solr, Artificial Intelligence",-,9am-6pm,"Full Time, Permanent",Ermofilex Rhythm Engineering,Organization,Ermofilex Rhythm Engineering,-,"Hyderabad, Chennai, Bengaluru","Hyderabad, Chennai, Bengaluru",-,-,-,15-25 Lacs P.A ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,NLP / DL Engineering / Architect
