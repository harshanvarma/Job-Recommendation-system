Combine this with our growing variable set of hundreds of potential features (and growing!), and this is a highly fertile environment for building, experimenting, refining and achieving real impact from your models. If models fire, the bottom-line impact to our teams is immediate - you see the value of your work incredibly fast.         ?       Who Are You         At a Staff level and above, our scientists are expected to come in with deep expertise and experience in Ad Tech, AI/ML, and Data Science, particularly at scale. Familiarity with big data processing and cloud computing will be critical to succeed in this environment.     In addition to possessing a mathematical aptitude, they need to be competent with data science languages and tools, such as Python or Apache Spark which will enable them to design scalable solutions for our advertising products, implement proof-of-concept, and evaluate them offline and online. They will also need to work with other engineers to take these solutions to live production and drive real business value.     Most importantly, we look for a passion to investigate and learn about the world from data, to ask interesting and provocative questions, and be driven to put real models into production that drive real business value.     We are open to diverse academic backgrounds, providing an intent to think and problem-solve like a data scientist. Our team includes engineers, mathematicians, computer scientists, physicists, economists and social scientists - a rock-star data scientist can come from any academic field.         Required:         Masters in a quantitative field such as Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, Statistics, Mathematics, Operations Research or Economics, Analytics, Data Science. Or Bachelors with additional experience.     10+ years of ad tech related industry experience working in Data Science teams. You would have applied algorithms and techniques such as NLP, Reinforcement Learning, Time Series, etc. from Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Statistics or other domains in solving real world problems and understand the practical issues of using these algorithms especially on large datasets.     Comfortable with software programming and statistical platforms such as R, Python etc.     Comfortable with the big data ecosystem and Apache Spark. Familiarity with Microsoft Azure, AWS, or Google Cloud/Vertex AI will be a bonus.     Comfortable collaborating with cross-functional teams.     Familiarity with challenges of the identity-less world, particularly for iOS and Android     Excellent technical and business communication skills and should know how to present technical ideas in a simple manner to business counterparts.     Possess a high degree of curiosity and ability to rapidly learn new subjects and              What will you do         You will be responsible for leading one or more data science efforts for one of the biggest performance DSPs in the world. This involves project ideation and conceptualization, solution design, measurement and solution iteration, coaching, deployment and post deployment management.     This will also include designing, development, testing of product experiments. You will need to guide junior members of the team in practical experiments, product design, model development and model evaluation. It is vital to be agile and iterate fast across experiment to deliver go-to-market ready products.     You are expected to be a hands-on part of the role where you will also actively analyse data, design and develop models, and problem-solve solutions with the rest of the team.     Additionally, stakeholder management is needed. It will involve being the interface with internal stakeholders such as our Product, Engineering, Data, Infrastructure, and Business teams.     Our team strives for thought leadership in the sector. We encourage and support all team members to write blogs, commentary and case studies published on the InMobi blog. We also support team members across our MLAI team to speak at industry conferences and represent InMobi s work.     You will learn how to design and build models for specific business problems. Even before that, you will be responsible for identifying the problem areas where AI can be applied to best business impact. You will learn to start a model design by anchoring in the business context and end user needs. You will learn how to connect model impact with real and measurable business impact.     You will work in a multi-functional team environment. You will collaborate and benefit from the skills of a diverse group of individuals from teams such as engineering, product, business, campaign management and creative development.     You will have the opportunity to experiment with multiple algorithms. Enduring learning comes from building, launching and reviewing performance of a particular algorithm; from asking why something worked or why it did not work; from asking how to tailor techniques to fit the problem at hand. We have an environment that makes this possible at speed.     Importantly, you will learn to become creative in designing models to be successful. Model design is not one-size-fits-all.

Product Data Scientist,"                                     Creates frameworks that identify recurring patterns.     Like a data scientist, a product scientist analyzes data and provide recommendations. However, they never solve the same problem twice. By identifying the right context and defining the problem clearly, a product scientist writes frameworks and algorithms to automate their work.                                    Starts from first principles     . Much of our work is in uncharted territory. A product scientist breaks down complicated problems into their basic elements and then reassembles them from the ground up. A product scientists asks, """"What information do I need to answer this question,"""" and, """"What questions can I answer given this information""""                                    Thinks like a builder     . A product scientist asks, """"How do we automate thisWhat needs to be doneand how do we get there"""" They take ideas and build them out into prototypes and products. A product scientist regularly solicits feedback so that they can fail fast.                                    Tells powerful data stories.     Stories, not dashboards, help align a group of builders around a shared strategic vision. A product scientist obsesses over how to tell the story of their insights. Programming for them is a mere skill, a means to an end. Data, metrics, statistics: these are proxies and tools for understanding what really matters.
