Negotiations:                           As abuyer, you need to interact with suppliers for various deals. The success orfailure of the deal depends on how effectively you are able to negotiate withyour suppliers. To gain maximum advantage from the suppliers, you need to keepin mind certain principles of negotiation.                     Negotiationis a process in which you and your supplier with conflicting requirements reachan agreement of mutual interest. It is thus all about creating a movementbetween each other.                     Theobjective of the negotiation process is to ensure the supply of five rights:right product or service at the right price, right time, right location andright quantity. You will have to balance these rights ie a faster productdelivery may result in a higher price.               Preparing a Negotiation:                           Beforemaking a deal, you need to prepare for it. You need to gather all the importantinformation that you may need to successfully execute the best possible deal.If you are prepared, you can steer the way the negotiation moves forward andclose it to your advantage.                     Beforeyou contact the suppliers, you need to do some homework. You need to gatherinformation such as your timelines and budget for the deal.                     Youhave to prepare and decide upfront the critical issues for the deal and whatyour targets are. Every deal has some critical issues. To identify theseissues, think what your internal customers are expecting from you. Afteridentifying the critical issues, you should put a target on each issue beforeyou enter a negotiation.                     For every issue, decide a wow anda walk-away target. These are two ends of a spectrum.                       Opening a Negotiation:                           Openingthe negotiation is all about starting on a friendly note and building a climatefor the negotiation, understanding the offer and listening attentively to whatthe supplier has to say.         In most circumstances, let the supplier talk first andtry to delay your opening offer as much as possible.                     Letthe supplier give you his one-way concessions and then make your offer.               Conducting a Negotiation:                           Afteryou have understood the supplier s offer, you should present your offer     Discuss all the negotiable requirements you identified before starting tonegotiate and bargain to get the most favorable offer on each requirement     Partof being a good negotiator is to extract information from the other party byasking relevant questions     The questions you ask and the manner in which youask them can impact the results of your negotiation              Closing a Negotiation:                           Duringa negotiation, you will come across several signals indicating it is time toclose the deal. When the supplier starts accepting your terms and conditionsand presents very few counter offers, the supplier is willing to close thedeal.                     Beforeclosing the deal, summarise all the points you have discussed to avoid anydisagreements at the later stage.                     Suppliersmay ask for a concession at the time of closing the deal. In such a situation,you should consider the importance of the deal, the time you have spent onnegotiation, the alternatives and the nature of supplier s demand.          If thedemand is not critical, it is not worth negotiating at this stage. If thesupplier asks for a concession on a critical component, you must not accept it.You should handle it by giving a credible explanation.
