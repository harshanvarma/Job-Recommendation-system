Content Writer (Technology),"Job Description Snapshot   Position : Content Writer  (Technology)    CTC : 3-5 Lac pa   Location : Noida  (Delhi NCR)    Building a product nation  I believe products bring real value and want to see India become a Product Nation.  Not IT Services,  not BPO powerhouse,  but an export house of scalable technology products.  I want the world to use off-the-shelf scalable software products made and handcrafted in India.     But it s not going to be easy.  We need to change our thinking,  ask difficult questions,  and come up with insane ideas.     For example,  I believe that all forms of transportation will become redundant one day,  making our lives much more efficient.  Our descendants will laugh at the idea that we actually drove our cars everyday to the other part of the town to be able to complete our work.  Sounds insane or exciting?    Getting the word out  To make a Product Nation,  the simple first step is a product.     And we built our first one.  Customers from about 114 countries are using it to connect their customers from offline print media to online content.     Scanova is a QR Code Management tool that allows businesses to create,  design,  manage,  and track QR Code-based interactions.     Scanova is a great product.  But how do we get the word out? How do we get people to notice us?   So we started blogging about it.  A lot.  And people did notice us.  We get about 100, 000 page views per month.     But you ll agree that s not enough.  We need to reach a million people  (or even a billion?)  if we are to build a great product company.  And for that,  we need you.      Building the right team  To achieve this vision,  I am looking for a team that believes in what we do and is hungry for challenges.  We are not looking for employees but hardcore problem-solvers.     Specifically,  we are looking for a  Content Writer  (Technology)  ,  who will be required to:    Content Generation    Research and brainstorm with team for topic ideas relevant to the target audience   Write full length blog articles  (300-1500 words)  for the company blog  ( http:/ / scanova. io/ blog )  following best practices of content marketing and SEO   Write answers on Quora for topics related to the business   Create posts for the company s social media platforms including Facebook,  Twitter,  Google ,  and LinkedIn   Conduct secondary and primary research to enhance quality of articles   Create images for articles using online tools such as Canva   If required,  develop content for website,  email newsletters,  and PR    Content Management    Operate and manage Wordpress CMS   View and report data via Google Analytics    Content Distribution    Schedule posts on social media platforms using management tools such as Buffer   Remain up-to-date on best Wordpress SEO practices to ensure higher rankings in search engines   Having the right skills  Passion and endurance are a must.  But we also expect a few other core competencies:   Excellent command over written and spoken English language   2 years of professional content writing experience  (online or print)    Good understanding of latest content-related SEO best practices   Basic understanding of CMS such as Wordpress and image editing tools  (Photoshop,  Canva,  Illustrator,  Sketch)    Should be passionate about technology and active in reading   Should be active on social media platforms other than Facebook/ Whatsapp   Hunger to make a dent in this world  We take care of each other  This is not just a team.  It s a family.  And in a family,  we take care of each other.  Here is what you get for being a part:    Salary - CTC 3-5 lac per annum   Medical insurance   Opportunity to work in a small team that empowers you to make your own decisions   Opportunity to become a specialist in Inbound Marketing   Opportunities to socialize and make friends - the team will be co-working at  Unboxed  in Noida  (Delhi NCR)    A little more about us  We call ourselves Trycon Technologies.  It was started in 2013 by Gautam Garg,  Mukesh Gupta,  and Swapnil Jain - all alumni of Delhi College of Engineering  (2010 & 2011 batch) .     After college we worked for a couple of years in companies like Grail Research,  Adobe,  and Oracle.  But like you,  we wanted more from life.  Not just money but freedom.  Freedom to use our potential and freedom to make a real dent in this world.  So we quit our jobs and came together in late 2013.     We are not alone.  Hyderabad-based Utthishta Seed Fund saw our progress and invested in us in 2015.     This is our story.  Let s meet up so that we can learn yours.
