Project Management and Prioritization: Work closely with design and development teams to implement the content changes/updates on the website test, measure, and iterate.         This is a hybrid role, its not fully remote. The person would be based in Bangalore. Our office is in Koramangala. We expect the person to work from the office 2-3 days a week and the rest from home.            What would be your impact           Improvement in traffic, engagement, and conversion metrics.         Is the website copy and content optimized for brand, product positioning, SEO, and conversions         Regular cadence for creating new content, updating or archiving old content, and conversion optimization experiments.            Why should you join           Culture: We value people who are obsessed with customers, take ownership of outcomes, execute fast, and are humble. We aim to build the most trusted customer engagement platform for the digital-first world. Trust is the operative word!         The team: An opportunity to work with the team that has [and still is] building a global SaaS brand from India. There is plenty of creative freedom to experiment with copy, content, design, and campaigns - we believe B2B marketing doesnt have to be boring. We are not building from scratch, but we are also not a mature enterprise yet - we are somewhere in the middle. But there are enough supporting teams/structures/processes etc, to make this job well-defined.          Your career growth: Marketing team members have worn different hats over the years. We have had field marketers move to product marketing, content marketers move to managerial roles, digital marketers move to regional demand gen roles, and more. So, if you are great at your job and have the potential to grow, we will usually have more challenges for you to solve.           Functional/ technical skills required:           Ability to produce clear/compelling copy and content. We are not looking for the most creative copywriter - but someone who can communicate to different personas simply, clearly, and compellingly.          Ability to understand the customer, their preferences, their journey, and their context in a deep manner.          Fair understanding of SEO - not looking for an expert, but someone who understands SEO enough to work with SEO experts.          Ability to understand some basic tech. Like understanding our product in-depth, being able to publish content through WordPress, understanding Google Analytics, managing projects through monday.com, etc            Domain knowledge/ experience           4-5 years of overall marketing experience.          Preferably in content marketing. But we are also okay if you dont have specialized content marketing experience. For example, If you have been a growth marketer/early-stage marketer in b2b tech companies, you might also be a good fit.          B2B tech experience is necessary. We are not looking for people with a B2C or consumer marketing background.
