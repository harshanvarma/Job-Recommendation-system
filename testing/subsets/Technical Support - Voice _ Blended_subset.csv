Technical Support Engineer,"   The L1 TSE candidate comes with a successful track record of using strong technical expertise in the cybersecurity domain of a fast-paced, enterprise SaaS company to provide world class, 24 x 7 globally available product support. Although relatively early in their career, with 2+ years relevant experience, they must have already shown the ability to effectively communicate with security professionals (e.g., SOC Analysts and management) and earn both industry and team-leading results for support case intake, along with response, update, and resolution SLA attainment.
