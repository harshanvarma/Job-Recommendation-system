Marketing Associate,"                       Sanitation workers play a crucial role in the sanitation service value chain, ensuring efficient and effective delivery of sanitation services to urban populations. Despite their essential role, many of these workers are employed on a part-time or irregular basis, which can lead to unstable incomes and livelihood insecurity.      Recognizing this challenge, IIHS (Indian Institute for Human Settlements) has undertaken experiments to explore alternative livelihood opportunities for sanitation workers.      These experiments have identified several options with the potential for scaling up.      For example, providing training, product development, tie-ups with input suppliers and marketing support have helped in setting up recycled wastepaper product manufacturing as a potential option.      Additionally, working with Self-Help Groups (SHGs) of sanitation workers can enable them to collectively address common challenges such as access to resources, common facility centers, scale of operation, etc.      By investing in alternative livelihood initiatives, IIHS aims to improve the economic well-being and social empowerment of sanitation workers while enhancing the overall resilience and sustainability of urban sanitation systems.

The role demands a thorough comprehension of the urban market landscape and a commitment to partnering with potential market players to stimulate demand for products manufactured by Self-Help Groups (SHGs).      It presents an exciting prospect to forge connections between SHGs and urban markets, thereby nurturing economic avenues and empowering marginalized communities.
