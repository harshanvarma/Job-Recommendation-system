Lead Partner Enablement Manager,"     The Lead Partner Enablement Manager    is part of the Partner Success team which has three primary functions: we enable partners; we credential partners; and we help partners grow their business.           Enabling partners in this context means that we ensure the consulting teams of our delivery partners are adequately trained to implement solutions with our products. While we may not necessarily do the training, we are responsible to ensure that it happens. This is more of a leading and coordinating role than a training role.         Credentialing partners means that we assess partner capability at the practice level and rate their maturity. In addition to evaluating the skills of individual consultants, credentialling here means assessing the partner s capability to manage and deliver a portfolio of projects.                     We also help our partners grow their consulting business by introducing new products into their consulting portfolio and expanding the types of consulting they do. This is primarily done through coaching and training.                 This role will be based in Pune and will serve as a critical lead for all testing partners in India.             Responsibilities:         Organize and coordinate enablement programs and events for partners, which may in some cases include doing the training.     Participate in the management of a portfolio of services offerings for partners, defining new offerings that partners need and removing those that are no longer in use.     Work with the services and sales teams to drive shared outcomes, which may include business development and, in some cases, doing billable work.     Collaborate with global team members to improve partner support systems and processes.     Liaise with director-level leadership from top global systems integrators (GSIs) to determine needs and opportunities.             Qualifications:         Bachelors degree in a technical field with at least 12+ years of related experience or equivalent work experience.

Familiarity with the SDLC and various testing methodologies, such as Agile and DevOps     Experience with SAP Basis and/or ABAP     Effective verbal and written communication skills.     Demonstrated experience in building and maintaining successful partnerships.     Strong analytical and problem-solving skills.     Ability to work collaboratively in a cross-functional team environment.     Excellent organizational and project management skills.
