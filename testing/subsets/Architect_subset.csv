This may involve creating initial sketches, 3D models, and renderings to help visualize design concepts.      Technical Drawings: They are responsible for preparing and revising detailed architectural drawings, including floor plans, elevations, sections, and construction details. This is a crucial part of the job, as these drawings are used for construction and permit applications.      Project Research: Interns may be required to conduct research related to the project, such as zoning codes, building materials, and construction techniques, to ensure compliance with local regulations and industry standards.      Site Visits: They often accompany senior architects to construction sites for inspections, surveys, and to ensure that the construction aligns with the design plans.      Computer-Aided Design (CAD): Proficiency in CAD software (e.g., AutoCAD and Revit) is essential for creating and editing architectural drawings.

Coordination: They work closely with other team members, such as structural engineers, interior designers, and contractors, to ensure that the project runs smoothly and all aspects of the design are integrated effectively.

Interns may assist in the process of obtaining building permits.      Documentation: They are responsible for maintaining organized project documentation, including drawings, specifications, and project correspondence.      Professional Development: Architectural interns often work towards obtaining their architectural license, which typically requires accumulating a specific number of supervised work hours.      Client Interaction: Depending on the firm and project, interns may interact with clients to present design ideas, updates, and revisions, under the guidance of senior architects.
