Interior Decorators," Meet Directly with Clients -> One of the most significant duties of an interior decorator is meeting directly with clients before, during, and after working on their space. In the initial meeting, the interior decorator gathers information related to the clients budget, timeline, and aesthetic and functional preferences. Throughout the decoration process, the client provides the interior decorator with feedback and direction.     Select Decorative Elements -> The interior decorators primary duty is selecting a variety of decorative elements for a clients home, office, or other space (such as a retail store). Working within the clients budget, the interior decorator chooses wall paint colors and finishes, furniture pieces, and textiles such as rugs and upholstery. They may also select art to hang on walls or feature on shelves.     Manage Budgets and Schedules -> Interior directors manage budgets and schedules throughout the decoration process. Budget management involves not only ensuring that decorations and furniture stay within the clients budget, but also ensuring profitability for the interior decorator. Managing schedules and deadlines is equally important, as interior decorators must maintain a steady workflow and meet client expectations to stay profitable.     Develop Decorative Plans -> After meeting with clients, the interior decorator develops several decorative plans and presents them to the client. They may present several big-picture options and ideas to the client, who then selects the idea they want to pursue. During this process, the interior decorator also determines whether a plan is feasible based on a clients budget and timeline.     Install and Arrange Decorations -> The interior decorator determines where to place the selected furniture and fixtures. In this aspect of the role, the interior decorator considers both aesthetic and practical considerations, with particular emphasis on unity and flow. After initially placing decorative elements, the interior decorator may fine-tune and rearrange the room on their own or with client input.     Direct Subcontractors -> In many cases, interior decorators also oversee and direct the activities of subcontractors. They may hire painters, floor refinishers, or carpenters to replace trim and molding in a clients space. They ensure these subcontractors complete their work according to schedule and without causing excessive inconvenience to the client. Interior decorators may also pay these subcontractors directly and bill the amount to the client.
