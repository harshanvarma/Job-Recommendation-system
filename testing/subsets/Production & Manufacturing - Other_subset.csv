Production Associate - Tamil Nadu Urban Sanitation Support Programme,"  About the Tamil Nadu Urban Sanitation Support Programme (TNUSSP) The TNUSSP was launched in November 2015, as the Techncial Support Unit (TSU) for the?Government of Tamil Nadu (GoTN) to make improvements in fecal sludge and septage?management (FSSM) along the full cycle of sanitation (FCS) across Tamil Nadu. A consortium?of organisations, the programme is led by the Indian Institute for Human Settlements (IIHS) to?make clean water and sanitation accessible. For more information on TNUSSP, please see?https://tnussp.co.in/ Job Description Sanitation workers play a crucial role in the sanitation service chain, ensuring efficient and effective delivery of sanitation services to urban populations. Despite their essential role, many of these workers are employed on a part-time or irregular basis, which can lead to unstable incomes and livelihood insecurity. Recognizing this challenge, IIHS (Indian Institute for Human Settlements) has undertaken experiments to explore alternative livelihood opportunities for sanitation workers. These experiments have identified several options with the potential for scaling up. For example, providing training, product development, tie-ups with input suppliers and marketing support have helped in setting up recycled wastepaper product manufacturing as a potential option. Additionally, working with Self-Help Groups (SHGs) of sanitation workers can enable them to collectively address common challenges such as access to resources, common facility centers, scale of operation, etc. By investing in alternative livelihood initiatives, IIHS aims to improve the economic well-being and social empowerment of sanitation workers while enhancing the overall resilience and sustainability of urban sanitation systems. TNUSSP is looking for a production associate to support the work for the development of alternative livelihoods for sanitation workers and their family members. The role demands a thorough understanding of the product portfolio manufactured by the target SHGs. This person shall be committed to working with target SHGs to improve their product portfolio, ensure quality or production at optimum cost, and timely delivery of orders, etc. The position presents an exciting prospect to work with SHGs to help them improve their product portfolio aimed at catering to urban markets, thereby nurturing economic avenues and empowering marginalized communities. This is a contractual position for an initial term of 11 months.
