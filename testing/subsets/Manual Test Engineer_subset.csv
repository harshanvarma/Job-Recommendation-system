Software Quality Analyst,"Behind every great software developer is an equally great tester. Once a product reaches a certain point in its development the developers must hand it over to the tester to see if it works (or doesn't work).  Testing plays an important role in the development of new IT programmes and many every day products,  like cars and electronic goods.  So,  what will I actually be doing?  It's your job to work as hard as you can to 'break' the new product to help the design process. You'll work closely with software designers and programme managers to understand more about what each product is meant to do,  its key features and who will use it. Then you'll run functional tests,  customer scenario testing,  stress testing,  performance testing,  scalability testing and international testing. The ultimate goal is to iron out any bugs and improve the quality of the finished product.You'll often be working on more than one project at a time,  one product in first phase testing and another in its second or final phase. This means you'll work around the demands of the project rather than the clock.  OK,  I'm interested... But is it really the job for me?  Software experience and knowledge is a given to work as a software tester.Other skills that employers will look for include:   A good understanding of the software development process  A good understanding of the business approach  Good judgment skills  Good writing skills (for documenting the process)  Good communications and consultancy skills  The ability to work in a team and as an individual  Good presentation skills  The ability to work under pressure and to tight deadlines  Expertise in Test Case Design,  Test Execution and Defect Management.

Testing," We at ACS strongly believe that a person takes a few months to understand a company s culture, products and systems. Historically speaking we have come to a conclusion that the first year of any person in an organization goes in learning and settling down.      The second year the person with more experience of a company s products, systems and processes is able to contribute to the organization and in the process of actually implementing what he or she has learned further grows in life and in the organization.      Hence we strongly believe that for any kind of association to be meaningful as well as profitable for both company and employee a long term association is a must. Consequently we encourage all candidates who are looking and can commit to at least a minimum of 2 years of association with ACS to apply.              Test Documentation.

QA Engineer - Shopify," The following are the guidelines and requirements for the Automation framework:      ?     1. Adhere to CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) for Automation framework.    2. Use an easy-to-understand framework, preferably BDD (Behaviour-Driven Development) implemented in a Given, When, Then format. This format helps both technical and non-technical users to    understand the test scenarios in plain language.    3. Provide comprehensive reporting and overview of what was tested, including the number of tests executed as part of a release, covering regression and smoke testing scenarios. All issues raised during    testing must be reported in Jira.    4. Maintain a common repository for all test cases in Jira, accessible , including both manual and automated tests.    5. Implement a regression suite maintenance process that includes handling production defects to prevent the recurrence of bugs in production.    (Atlassian) Jira / Confluence Confluence is used for all our KT and documentation, including post-mortems, operational processes and procures, the release.change calendar and technicalarchitecture.    6. Do not maintain separate smoke and regression suites but use test case tagging to run only smoke or only regression tests, or both.    7. Implement unit testing during the development cycle, and share the details.    8. Optimise the handling of the Automation backlog, which includes tests and bugs.    9. Efficiently manage defects through effective Root Cause Analysis (RCA) sessions and take actions to avoid their recurrence.    10. Provide brand-wise reporting for regression testing to allow better insights into the testing coverage.    11. Focus on introducing API testing to reduce the reliance on UI testing for functionality checks.    12. Daily maintenance of the regression suite to address failing and flaky test cases.    13. Implement Requirement Traceability to map requirements to test cases.    14. Have dedicated Test environments with Production data, configuration, and content synchronised with the production environment.    15. Update the regression suite based on the progression of test cases as new functionalities are added or existing ones are modified.    16. Clear and designated Single Points of Contact (SPOCs) for specific queries within the AMS team is essential for effective communication and issue resolution, covering: deployment-related queries, there should be one designated SPOC who will handle all questions and concerns related to deployments and for environment-related queries, another SPOC should be assigned to address any issues or inquiries concerning environments.          *By following these guidelines, the Automation framework will be robust, efficient, and align with testing standards and practices.      *Having these designated SPOCs documented under the Confluence page will provide visibility to everyone involved in the project/support process. This documentation will serve as a quick reference for      team members, enabling them to know exactly who to reach out to for specific types of questions or problems.      *Having clear communication channels and SPOCs will streamline the support process and enhance collaboration within the AMS team. It also ensures that important information and knowledge are      shared effectively, leading to better incident management and issue resolution.      QA process:        QA should be involved in all the meetings - refinement , sprint planning, RCA meetings, retrospectives      Test management tool to be used for Sprint Test execution(Jira, zephyr).      Requirement traceability matrix to map requirements to the test cases.      Test cases to be drafted before the sprint start and get reviewed by QA team.      Final QA sign off should be from QA team.      Test cases should be with detailed test steps, actual result and expected result.      Clear visibility for what is been tested with evidences(Screenshots, video recordings) and related bugs if any to be linked to the JIRA ticket(story/epic)      RCA process for every production bug, process to not see it again by adding it to automation regression suite.      Defect management      Defect backlog to be maintained and reduced with every sprint incoming.        Every defect should have below details    - Steps to reproduce    - Evidence(screenshots, logs)    Environment details    Test data    Expected and actual results    Requirement reference for every defect",180000000000.0,18-04-2024,17-07-2024,EducationalOccupationalCredential,24,Engineering - Software & QA,Manual Test Engineer,IT Services & Consulting,"automation framework, RCA, project support, Test execution, Test scenarios, Incident management, Regression testing, Test cases, Unit testing, JIRA",-,9am-6pm,"Full Time, Permanent",Photon,Organization,Photon,https://img.naukimg.com/logo_images/groups/v1/4619011.gif,Chennai,Chennai,-,-,-,Not disclosed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Manual Test Engineer

QA team leads manage the day-to-day activities of QA team members, including scheduling and managing ongoing projects. They also conduct employee training and evaluation and may provide support during the hiring and onboarding process. QA team leads need to assess current testing needs and schedules and determine staffing needs to effectively conduct the testing.
