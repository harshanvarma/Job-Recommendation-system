How to get your dream Internet job,"Decide. From where you are right now,  there are many career options open to you. Is the Internet high on your list of career options? How determined are you to get into the Internet industry? If the Internet industry is all you've set your sight on,  go all out for it. Do as much work on the Internet related to your line of interest,  meet people doing the kind of work you'd like to do,  develop contacts.  Portfolio. If you're applying for an Internet job,  it makes sense to showcase the work you have done on the Internet. Create a personal homepage with your resume,  exhibiting some work you've done in whatever line you're planning to apply for a job in. Homepages are easy to create and free - create your online resume at Rediff Personal Homepages (http:/ / members.rediff.com/ ).  Shortlist. Jot down the names of Internet companies that have the kind of jobs that you're interested in. Visit their websites (if they're an Internet company,  they're bound to have a website),  and learn more about them,  the work they do,  and the job requirements they have. Most of these websites have a ""we're hiring"" section that you can easily go to. Others ask you to send in your resume to them via their website. In that case,  put your homepage address,  so they get a detailed sampling of your work.  Search. Visit recruitment sites on the Internet that offer thousands of jobs from all over the country or even all over the world. Most of them offer you a simple search interface that allows you to use certain criteria to find the job you're interested in. Other sites allow you to list yourself for a fee,  so that prospective employers can find you. Don't depend only on these services but evaluate the effectiveness of these services by getting in touch with people who have used them.  Persevere. The Internet industry is changing everyday - new technologies and products are talked about every other day. Update your skills and as long as you love what you're doing - it'll be fun.
