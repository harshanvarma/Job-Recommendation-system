Sr. Threat Researcher,"               Leading the charge for understanding the activity of malware today is the Threat Research team        With a focus on malware research, the primary role of the team is to understand relevant threats and techniques used in malware that are threatening our customer s business      The challenge is the enormous scale of malware today and sheer number of samples required to be addressed      This takes a more creative approach than traditional Anti-Virus research, focusing on one sample at a time      The modern threat lab requires an economy of scale through automation and machine learning to allow people to focus on new learnings, and let systems continue to identify malware based on what the team has learned                         What You ll Do:                The Threat Analyst will take input from many sources and validate if those threats are something Falcon can mount an effective defense against.              The analysis can range from simple execution and review of the behaviors to reverse engineering.              As Falcon is first a behavior based system, understanding how the threat is working and what it is doing to interact with the host environment can be important.              The Threat Analyst will be expected to use the appropriate technique to efficiently understand the threat to identify how to best mitigate it.              The Threat Analyst will work with other stakeholders and create automations for processing large numbers of samples.              The analyst needs to have a good understanding of various file formats and familiarity with unpacking of common packers.              As the gateway to the response organization for many new threats, good cross team collaboration skills are important.              Clear, effective communication of technical details in a means which is actionable is the key to success.              Automate processes to reduce time and manual effort in the analysis of threats.              The analyst needs to understand the bigger picture of threat analysis and work with stakeholders to reduce manual steps.                  This role will be looked on as the go to person when the team needs to quickly process a large amount of samples with custom parsers or create custom file type specific processing workflows.              Leaning on a proven track record of threat analysis, the successful candidate will be comfortable working to focus on the appropriate threats and identifying automation opportunities.

Senior Engineer - Rebar,"                         Designing Reinforcement Structures           : The primary responsibility of a rebar engineer is to design reinforcement structures based on architectural and structural drawings, engineering principles, and local building codes and regulations. This involves determining the size, spacing, and layout of reinforcing bars (rebars) to ensure the structural integrity and strength of concrete elements like beams, columns, slabs, and foundations.                           Calculations and Analysis           : Rebar engineers perform calculations and analysis using structural engineering software to assess the forces, stresses, and loads acting on reinforced concrete elements. They ensure that the reinforcement design can withstand anticipated loads, including dead loads, live loads, wind loads, and seismic forces.                           Material Selection           : Selecting appropriate reinforcement materials, such as steel bars and mesh, based on project specifications, structural requirements, and environmental conditions. This includes considering factors like material strength, corrosion resistance, and durability.                           Detailing and Drafting           : Creating detailed reinforcement drawings and schedules that specify the placement, quantity, and configuration of rebars within concrete elements. These drawings provide guidance for construction workers and contractors during the fabrication and installation of reinforcement.                           Collaboration           : Collaborating with architects, structural engineers, contractors, and other stakeholders throughout the design and construction process to ensure that the reinforcement design aligns with the overall project goals, timelines, and budget constraints.                           Quality Assurance           : Conducting quality assurance checks to verify compliance with design specifications, building codes, and industry standards. This may involve inspecting reinforcement materials, reviewing shop drawings, and performing on-site inspections during construction.                           Problem Solving           : Identifying and resolving design issues, construction challenges, and unforeseen complications related to reinforcement, such as conflicts with other building systems or unexpected site conditions. Rebar engineers must be adept at finding practical solutions while maintaining structural integrity and safety.                           Documentation and Reporting           : Maintaining accurate records of design calculations, drawings, correspondence, and project documentation. Rebar engineers may also prepare technical reports, progress updates, and as-built drawings to document the evolution of the reinforcement design throughout the project lifecycle.
