Marketing Associate - Tamil Nadu Urban Sanitation Support Programme,"About the Tamil Nadu Urban Sanitation Support Programme (TNUSSP) The TNUSSP was launched in November 2015, as the Techncial Support Unit (TSU) for the?Government of Tamil Nadu (GoTN) to make improvements in fecal sludge and septage?management (FSSM) along the full cycle of sanitation (FCS) across Tamil Nadu. A consortium?of organisations, the programme is led by the Indian Institute for Human Settlements (IIHS) to?make clean water and sanitation accessible. For more information on TNUSSP, please see?https://tnussp.co.in/ Job Description Sanitation workers play a crucial role in the sanitation service value chain, ensuring efficient and effective delivery of sanitation services to urban populations. Despite their essential role, many of these workers are employed on a part-time or irregular basis, which can lead to unstable incomes and livelihood insecurity. Recognizing this challenge, IIHS (Indian Institute for Human Settlements) has undertaken experiments to explore alternative livelihood opportunities for sanitation workers. These experiments have identified several options with the potential for scaling up. For example, providing training, product development, tie-ups with input suppliers and marketing support have helped in setting up recycled wastepaper product manufacturing as a potential option. Additionally, working with Self-Help Groups (SHGs) of sanitation workers can enable them to collectively address common challenges such as access to resources, common facility centers, scale of operation, etc. By investing in alternative livelihood initiatives, IIHS aims to improve the economic well-being and social empowerment of sanitation workers while enhancing the overall resilience and sustainability of urban sanitation systems. TNUSSP is looking for a marketing associate to support the work for the development of alternative livelihoods for sanitation workers and their family members. The role demands a thorough comprehension of the urban market landscape and a commitment to partnering with potential market players to stimulate demand for products manufactured by Self-Help Groups (SHGs). It presents an exciting prospect to forge connections between SHGs and urban markets, thereby nurturing economic avenues and empowering marginalized communities. This is a contractual position for an initial term of 11 months. Activities and Tasks Responsibilities would include, but not be limited to, the following: Conducting in-depth market research to identify potential markets, target audiences, and competition for SHG products (sanitary napkin disposal pouches, aprons, wastepaper products, cleaning material  phenyl, toilet cleaner, floor cleaner, etc.); Analysing market trends, customer preferences, and emerging opportunities for product diversification; Developing and executing comprehensive marketing strategies to promote SHG products, including files, folders, sanitary products, and cloth products; Identifying prospective market players such as hotels, FMCG wholesalers, and readymade garment shops, and conducting regular personal visits to establish strong relationships and showcase the value of SHG products; these visits should aim to secure partnerships, product placements, and bulk orders; Leveraging networking and relationship-building skills to engage with key decision-makers and influencers within these market segments; Identifying potential sales channels and distribution networks to reach a wider customer base; Building and maintaining relationships with retailers, wholesalers, and any other potential partners for generating regular orders and release of payment; Tracking and analysing the effectiveness of marketing campaigns and adjusting strategies as needed; Providing support to other IIHS activities including academics, research, training, practice, operations and others; Participating in all activities of Institution-Building at IIHS; carrying out tasks as assigned by IIHS; and travelling on IIHS work within the country as and when needed. Structure and Reporting The marketing associate will be an External Consultant coordinating with the livelihoods expert on the TNUSSP team and will be required to collaborate effectively with a diverse group of internal teams and external individuals/organisations. Person Specification The ideal candidate should have: A professional degree in Marketing, Development Studies, Social Work, or related discipline; 2-5 years of relevant experience in providing market development support to urban livelihoods projects; Experience of working in multi-disciplinary teams; Good people management skills; Proficiency in Tamil language is mandatory.
