Customer Success Manager,"    Customer success and customer support are two distinct but closely related functions within a business that focus on enhancing the customer experience. Here are the key differences between customer success and customer support: Focus on Customer Lifecycle: Customer Success:  Customer success is concerned with the entire customer lifecycle. It involves activities that go beyond addressing immediate issues and aims to ensure the long-term success and satisfaction of the customer. It focuses on understanding the customer's goals, helping them achieve those goals, and fostering a positive, ongoing relationship. Customer Support:  Customer support, on the other hand, primarily deals with addressing and resolving immediate customer issues and inquiries. It is often reactive, responding to customer problems or questions as they arise. Proactive vs Reactive: Customer Success:  Customer success is proactive in nature. It involves understanding customer needs, providing guidance, and offering resources to help customers derive maximum value from the product or service. It anticipates potential challenges and works to prevent them. Customer Support:  Customer support is typically reactive, responding to customer issues and inquiries as they arise. It focuses on resolving problems and providing assistance in real-time. Goal Orientation: Customer Success:  The primary goal of customer success is to ensure that customers achieve their desired outcomes with the product or service. This may involve helping them utilize features effectively, providing education and training, and offering strategic guidance. Customer Support:  The main goal of customer support is to resolve customer issues, answer questions, and provide technical assistance. It aims to address immediate concerns and ensure customer satisfaction in the short term.
